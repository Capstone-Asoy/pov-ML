In Jonathan Ashley's dark humor debut crime novel, a Louisville bookstore owner leaves his used volumes of Yeats behind to get into the drug trade and make some real money.
Jon Catlett, a misanthropic literary obsessive, is facing the loss of the only thing in the world he loves; his used bookstore, a haven for fellow weirdos, outcasts, misunderstood geniuses and malcontents. Jon has several other problems, the least of which are his love affair with a bi-polar femme fatale heiress to a thriving northern steel company or the exponentially growing opiate habit he has developed.
When Jon, during a deal gone wrong, accidentally kills a fellow drug addict, getting away with murder turns out to be the least of his worries. The steps he and Paul, the obsessive-compulsive manager of Jon's store, must take to cover up the killing result in the two cornering Louisville's blossoming heroin trade.
From West End gangbangers to dirty cops and crusading narcotics detectives, Jon and his unstable partner in crime must dilute their morals and thicken their skin if they are to have any hope of surviving the lucrative but deadly life they've stumbled upon.

""Ashley breaks our hearts, he breaks all the rules and, most importantly, he breaks our expectations of what a simple crime story can be. He shatters it, in fact, leaving readers craving another deadly taste--much like the lost souls in this chilling, amazing story.""

""We live in a capitalistic society, yes, but nobody said doing business is easy or even enjoyable. Jonathan Ashley makes this point quite well in The Cost of Doing Business. Of course when the business is the heroin trade, the stakes are life and death, but is the suspicion, the betrayal, the plotting and scheming, all that different than what goes on in the corporate world? Louisville bookstore owner Jon Catlett leaves his used volumes of Yeats behind to get into the drug trade and make some real money, and the result is blood-filled mayhem. He never loses his sense of literate irony, though, taking us through a fast, unpredictable novel with equal parts darkness and humor. A very confident debut.""

What do I mean by 'vibrant interracial' romance? I want my stories and characters to resonate -- to set off an empathetic vibration in my readers because life has taken them into some of the same valleys and has them hoping to reach the same mountain tops.
I love my characters, and I don't want to say their emotions are my playground, but I do believe I can bring out through them -- feelings, life experiences, joy and pain that most anyone can relate to. I don't put them through all their struggles just to create drama-- they're headed somewhere. On their way to discover real connection to another person, a true soul mate. The good and bad they've lived through before they get to that glorious place are the seeds planted so that Love may bloom.

In a book of unprecedented scope, McGilchrist draws on a vast body of recent brain research, illustrated with case histories, to reveal that the difference is profound--not just this or that function, but two whole, coherent, but incompatible ways of experiencing the world. The left hemisphere is detail oriented, prefers mechanisms to living things & is inclined to self-interest. The right hemisphere has greater breadth, flexibility & generosity. This division helps explain the origins of music & language, & casts new light on the history of philosophy, as well as on some mental illnesses. The 2nd part of the book takes a journey thru the history of Western culture, illustrating the tension between these two worlds as revealed in the thought & belief of thinkers & artists, from Aeschylus to Magritte. He argues that, despite its inferior grasp of reality, the left hemisphere is increasingly taking precedence in the modern world, with potentially disastrous consequences.

Tray Dunaway longs to be part of the popular set at school but she's growing too fast and her clothes no longer fit. The only person who understands Tray's need for acceptance is her grandmother, but when Tray wears Gram's hand-sewn clothes to school, the kids make fun of her tall, boney appearance. Tray's luck improves when Pee Wee Johnson, a down-and-out friend of her father's, buys two lottery tickets and gives one to Mr. Dunaway as a thank-you for driving him to Hazard, Illinois.

Burdened down with a bag of pot and a lot of guilt over the person he killed, Alistair needs to escape. He wants out from the turf war brewing in Swansea between a bunch of criminals. He wants out from the acid-munching cops on the verge of madness and from his idiot friends who spend their time talking about the meaning of life and interspecies wrestling.
Plus, there's a girl involved...
Getting out isn't going to be that easy though. Whether negotiating his notice with inept mobsters, dodging delusional vigilantes or avoiding that 'thing' in the shadows, escaping is going to be seriously tough.

26,76,eng,3.57,"Where Borders Bleed is a keenly observed and anecdotal account of a factious landscape that has long engaged global attention: the Indo-Pak region. Covering almost seventy years of conflict, it chronicles the events leading up to Partition, reflects on the consequent strife, and provides a fresh, discursive perspective on the figures who have shaped the story of this land from Lord Louis Mountbatten and Muhammad Ali Jinnah to Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh.
Covering historical, diplomatic and military perspectives, Where Borders Bleed is intrepid, engaging with a range of contentious issues that have shaped Indo-Pak relations water sharing, Kashmir and Article 370. Equally, it is speculative. It asks: would terror have affected the world the way it has, if PakIndia had been a benign single entity? What if India and Pakistan were to reunite, much like East and West Germany? As the now-largest nation in the world, would the mammoth PakIndia radically change the globe s geo-political framework?
These questions combined with the author s own diplomatic access to rare archival material and key leaders across borders make this a one-of-a-kind book on the story of India and Pakistan.
A compellingly written account of India, Pakistan and the history of the subcontinent, rich in anecdote.
Written by India's former consul general to Karachi, the book presents rare archival material, interviews and insights into the lives of key Indo-Pak leaders.

Once upon a time, Aveda Jupiter (aka Annie Chang) was demon-infested San Francisco's most beloved superheroine, a beacon of hope and strength and really awesome outfits. But all that changed the day she agreed to share the spotlight with her best friend and former assistant Evie Tanaka--who's now a badass, fire-wielding superheroine in her own right. They were supposed to be a dynamic duo, but more and more, Aveda finds herself shoved into the sidekick role. Where, it must be said, she is not at all comfortable.
It doesn't help that Aveda's finally being forced to deal with fallout from her diva behavior--and the fact that she's been a less than stellar friend to Evie. Or that Scott Cameron--the man Aveda's loved for nearly a decade--is suddenly giving her the cold shoulder after what seemed to be some promising steps toward friendship. Or that the city has been demon-free for three months in the wake of Evie and Aveda's apocalypse-preventing battle against the evil forces of the Otherworld, leaving Aveda without the one thing she craves most in life: a mission.
All of this is causing Aveda's burning sense of heroic purpose--the thing that's guided her all these years--to falter.
In short, Aveda Jupiter is having an identity crisis.
When Evie gets engaged and drafts Aveda as her maid-of-honor, Aveda finally sees a chance to reclaim her sense of self and sets out on a single-minded mission to make sure Evie has the most epic wedding ever. But when a mysterious, unseen supernatural evil rises up and starts attacking brides-to-be, Aveda must summon both her superheroine and best friend mojo to take down the enemy and make sure Evie's wedding goes off without a hitch--or see both her city and her most important friendship destroyed forever.",Daw Books,384.0,2017.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32970513-heroine-worship,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1493515355m/32970513.jpg,"Heroine Worship (Heroine Complex, #2)",Sarah Kuhn,9780756413262,"['Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Superheroes', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal']"

Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) allow organizations to manage and back up huge file systems quickly, thereby keeping their lifeblood flowing. W. Curtis Preston's insightful book takes you through the ins and outs of building and managing large data centers using SANs and NAS.
As a network administrator you're aware that multi-terabyte data stores are common and petabyte data stores are starting to appear. Given this much data, how do you ensure that it is available all the time, that access times and throughput are reasonable, and that the data can be backed up and restored in a timely manner? SANs and NAS provide solutions that help you work through these problems, with special attention to the difficulty of backing up huge data stores.
This book explains the similarities and differences of SANs and NAS to help you determine which, or both, of these complementing technologies are appropriate for your network. Using SANs, for instance, is a way to share multiple devices (tape drives and disk drives) for storage, while NAS is a means for centrally storing files so they can be shared. Preston exams each technology with a vendor neutral approach, starting with the building blocks of a SAN and how they can be assembled for effective storage solutions. He covers day-to-day management and backup and recovery for both SANs and NAS in detail.
Whether you're a seasoned storage administrator or a network administrator charged with taking on this role, you'll find all the information you need to make informed architecture and data management decisions. The book fans out to explore technologies such as RAID and other forms of monitoring that will help complement your data center. With an eye on the future, other technologies that might affect the architecture and management of the data center are explored.

79,187,eng,4.18,"""A fascinating new perspective on modern finance,"" --Oliver Hart, 2016 Nobel Laureate in Economics
""Lucid, witty and delightfully erudite...From the French revolution to film noir, from the history of probability to Jane Austen and The Simpsons, this is an astonishing intellectual feast."" --Sebastian Mallaby, author of The Man Who Knew: The Life and Times of Alan Greenspan
In 1688, essayist Josef de la Vega described finance as both ""the fairest and most deceitful business . . . the noblest and the most infamous in the world, the finest and most vulgar on earth.""
The characterization of finance as deceitful, infamous, and vulgar still rings true today - particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But, what happened to the fairest, noblest, and finest profession that de la Vega saw?
De la Vega hit on an essential truth that has been forgotten: finance can be just as principled, life-affirming, and worthyas it can be fraught with questionable practices. Today, finance is shrouded in mystery for outsiders, while many insiders are uneasy with the disrepute of their profession. How can finance become more accessible and also recover its nobility?
Harvard Business School professor Mihir Desai, in his ""last lecture"" to the graduating Harvard MBA class of 2015, took up the cause of restoring humanity to finance. With incisive wit and irony, his lecture drew upon a rich knowledge of literature, film, history, and philosophy to explain the inner workings of finance in a manner that has never been seen before.
This book captures Desai's lucid exploration of the ideas of finance as seen through the unusual prism of the humanities. Through this novel, creative approach, Desai shows that outsiders can access the underlying ideas easily and insiders can reacquaint themselves with the core humanity of their profession.
The mix of finance and the humanities creates unusual pairings: Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope are guides to risk management; Jeff Koons becomes an advocate of leverage; and Mel Brooks's The Producersteaches us about fiduciary responsibility. In Desai's vision, the principles of finance also provide answers to critical questions in our lives. Among many surprising parallels, bankruptcy teaches us how to react to failure, the lessons of mergers apply to marriages, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model demonstrates the true value of relationships.
THE WISDOM OF FINANCE is a wholly unique book, offering a refreshing new perspective on one of the world's most complex and misunderstood professions.",Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,223.0,2017.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30971680-the-wisdom-of-finance,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1475307109m/30971680.jpg,The Wisdom of Finance: Discovering Humanity in the World of Risk and Return,Mihir Desai,9780544911130,"['Finance', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Money']"

Worship leader and recording artist Laura Story's life took an unexpected turn when her husband, Martin, was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Their lives would never be the same. Yes, with God all things are possible. But the devastating news was that no cure existed to restore Martin's short-term memory, eyesight, and other complications. The fairy-tale life Laura had dreamed of was no longer possible. And yet in struggling with God about how to live with broken dreams, Laura has found joy and a deeper intimacy with Jesus.
Laura helps us understand we aren't the only ones whose lives have taken unexpected turns. She examines the brokenness of some of the heroes of our faith, and shows how despite their flaws and flawed stories, God was able to use them in extraordinary ways. And it was not because of their faith, but because of the faithfulness of their God. God may not fix everything.

Is matter infinitely divisible into ever-smaller pieces? But infinity is also the place where things happen that don't.

To My Dog Blanco

A willing vassal at my feet;
Glad partner of my home and fare,
My shadow in the street;

Where love and loyal homage shine,
And wonder where the difference lies
Between your soul and mine!
I scan the whole broad earth around
For that one heart which, leal and true,
Bears friendship without end or bound,
And find the prize in you.

Or follow where my Master trod

What I became interested in is the darker side of etiquette--the way people conduct themselves in situations that Emily Post would never write about. This book started with the story 'The Etiquette of Adultery.' I loved that title and all that it suggested. Was there an etiquette, a set of unwritten rules, for a situation that seemed to break all the rules of a 'decent' society? From there, the collection grew--exploring the etiquette of obesity, dementia, infertility, arson, etc. These stories were really fun to write for two reasons. One, they allowed me to experiment with form, writing in small sections, chapters, definitions and other pieces of a suggested larger text. And two, I loved seeing how the characters emerged from each story. Each person in these ten stories ends up writing their own codes of etiquette, which I think is actually true in life. We all have our rules, our moral codes, our lines that we won't cross. It's when we cross those lines that things get really interesting.""",Matter Press,88.0,2012.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16075239-modern-manners-for-your-inner-demons,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349709232m/16075239.jpg,Modern Manners for Your Inner Demons,Tara Laskowski,9780983792840,['Short Stories']
114,267,eng,4.25,"Leonora Carrington developed an iconography of myth, occultism and alchemy that has resonated strongly with younger artists over the past decade and a half. Incredibly gifted as a technician, Carrington was also possessed of a wild imagination, which she realized with great precision in her canvases. Her leading role as a Surrealist in Paris immediately prior to the war, and her life in Mexico City alongside fellow Surrealist expats Remedios Varo, Kati Horna and Edward James, have been the subject of increased interest and scholarly research. This is the first overview of her work to be published since her death in 2011 at the age of 94. Beautifully produced, with a faux-leather binding, a die-cut cover with foil stamping and 138 color plates (including two gatefolds), this volume looks at the many influences on Carrington's many lives. It explores the Celtic imagery that enchanted her as a child, and the Mexican myths, imagery and stories that informed the second half of her career. Metamorphosis and transformation is an ongoing theme in Carrington's hybrid world, populated with disconcerting hybrid creatures, elongated women and people metamorphosing into birds. This theme also emerges on a more intimate level in her self-portraits and portraits of friends and family. Writing was of equal importance as painting for Carrington, and this volume is supplemented with excerpts from unpublished manuscripts.
Leonora Carrington (1917-2011) was born in Lancashire, England. In 1936, she saw Max Ernst's work at the International Surrealist Exhibition in London, and met the artist at a party the following year. They became a couple almost immediately; when the outbreak of the Second World War separated them, Carrington was devastated, and fled to Spain, then Lisbon, where she married Renato Leduc, a Mexican diplomat, and escaped to Mexico, where she eventually established herself as one of the country's most beloved artists.",Irish Museum Of Modern Art,160.0,2013.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17991730-leonora-carrington,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389575610m/17991730.jpg,Leonora Carrington,Sean Kissane,9781938922206,"['Art', 'Nonfiction']"

In this bold, fascinating book, Biss investigates the metaphors and myths surrounding our conception of immunity and its implications for the individual and the social body. As she hears more and more fears about vaccines, Biss researches what they mean for her own child, her immediate community, America, and the world, both historically and in the present moment. She extends a conversation with other mothers to meditations on Voltaire's Candide, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, Susan Sontag's AIDS and Its Metaphors, and beyond.

Furtive Liaison
A ""quickie"" is all Shawn Delaney wants when he meets Marc Wright at a XXX bookstore. Instead, he discovers instant, explosive chemistry with a man with whom he has nothing in common. The last thing he wants is a long-term relationship with anyone, much less an impulsive guy sporting chipped black nail polish.
To a workaholic like Shawn, ""love"" is a four-letter word, until Marc strolls into his life and turns it upside down in the best way possible. And for the first time in his life, Shawn isn't concentrating on work.
But the discovery of a simple yellow rubber ducky in Marc's luggage sends Shawn on a downward spiral of confusion about his lover's history and fidelity, and eventually, it leads to heartbreak. Has their entire relationship been nothing more than the illusion of happiness, or could there be more to Marc's betrayal than meets the eye?
Precious Ache
Falling in love was his biggest mistake...
Abandoned as a child, Dave Blanchard learned to be self-reliant at an early age. Puberty brought a distressing attraction to other boys, and an abnormal growth spurt that drove Dave further into his shell. Adulthood granted him the freedom to stand on his own two feet, but cloistered him in a plastic bubble of his own making. At seven and a half feet tall, Dave has no problem finding men for anonymous sex through sleazy backroom romps, but the experiences leave him feeling cold and unsatisfied.

These manuals seldom go beyond teaching how to avoid the problems of punctuation, grammar, and style that at one time or another ensnare the best of writers. Few, if any, of these books explore writing as a way of shaping thought.
V.A. Howard and J.H. Barton, two Harvard researchers in education, take a radically different approach. While they agree with their predecessors that an important function of writing is the clear, direct expression of thought, they point out that many of our thoughts first come into being only when put to paper. By failing to recognize the link between thinking and writing, we fall into the deadlock innappropriately named writer's block.
Thinking on Paper shows how writer's block as well as many other writing problems are engendered by the tendency, supported by traditional approaches, to separate thinking from writing.

After running an ultramarathon through the Copper Canyons of Mexico, Christopher McDougall finds his next great adventure on the razor-sharp mountains of Crete, where a band of Resistance fighters in World War II plotted the daring abduction of a German general from the heart of the Nazi occupation. How did a penniless artist, a young shepherd, and a playboy poet believe they could carry out such a remarkable feat of strength and endurance, smuggling the general past thousands of Nazi pursuers, with little more than their own wits and courage to guide them?
McDougall makes his way to the island to find the answer and retrace their steps, experiencing firsthand the extreme physical challenges the Resistance fighters and their local allies faced. On Crete, the birthplace of the classical Greek heroism that spawned the likes of Herakles and Odysseus, McDougall discovers the tools of the hero--natural movement, extraordinary endurance, and efficient nutrition. All of these skills, McDougall learns, are still practiced in far-flung pockets throughout the world today.
More than a mystery of remarkable people and cunning schemes, Natural Born Heroesis a fascinating investigation into the lost art of the hero, taking us from the streets of London at midnight to the beaches of Brazil at dawn, from the mountains of Colorado to McDougall's own backyard in Pennsylvania, all places where modern-day athletes are honing ancient skills so they're ready for anything.

In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultraof all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.
But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business--a business that would be dynamic, different.
Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream--along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers.

enemies he hunted and ""the legend"" by his Navy SEAL brothers . ..
From 1999 to 2009, U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle recorded the most career
sniper kills in United States military history. The Pentagon has
officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyles kills (the previous
American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the
astonishing total number for this book. Iraqi insurgents feared Kyle
so much they named him al-Shaitan (""the devil"") and placed a bounty
on his head. Kyle earned legendary status among his fellow SEALs,
Marines, and U.S. Army soldiers, whom he protected with deadly
accuracy from rooftops and stealth positions. Gripping and
unforgettable, Kyle's masterful account of his extraordinary
battlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of all
time. A native Texan who learned to shoot on childhood hunting trips
with his father, Kyle was a champion saddle-bronc rider prior to
joining the Navy. After 9/11, he was thrust onto the front lines of
the War on Terror, and soon found his calling as a world-class sniper
who performed best under fire. He recorded a personal-record
2,100-yard kill shot outside Baghdad; in Fallujah, Kyle braved heavy
fire to rescue a group of Marines trapped on a street; in Ramadi, he
stared down insurgents with his pistol in close combat. Kyle talks
honestly about the pain of war--of twice being shot and experiencing
the tragic deaths of two close friends. American Sniper also honors
Kyles fellow warriors, who raised hell on and off the battlefield.
And in moving first-person accounts throughout, Kyles wife, Taya,
speaks openly about the strains of war on their marriage and
children, as well as on Chris. Adrenaline-charged and deeply
personal, American Sniper is a thrilling eyewitness account of war

169,377,eng,4.51,"What history records as the Hundred Years War was in fact a succession of destructive conflicts, separated by tense intervals of truce and dishonest and impermanent peace treaties, and one of the central events in the history of England and France. It laid the foundations of France's national consciousness, even while destroying the prosperity and political preeminence which France had once enjoyed. It formed the nation's institutions, creating the germ of the absolute state of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In England, it brought intense effort and suffering, a powerful tide of patriotism, great fortune succeeded by bankruptcy, disintegration, and utter defeat. The war also brought turmoil and ruin to neighboring Scotland, Germany, Italy, and Spain.Trial by Fire, the second volume of Jonathan Sumption's monumental history of the Hundred Years War, takes up the story in 1347, the year the Truce of Calais was negotiated. When the French repudiated the truce in August 1349 it was to initiate a series of engagements with the English until Edward's last campaign in 1360. After this point the strength of the English companies in France declined, and their presence became a serious diplomatic embarrassment. At the same time, the fragmentation of French society became apparent as violent groups of Bretons, Bearnais, Navarrese, Germans, and above all Gascons roved the land. It was not until the marriage of Philip of Burgundy and Margaret of Flanders, in 1369, that the consolidation of France's territories was achieved.",Faber & Faber,655.0,2001.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/300041.Trial_by_Fire,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327405894m/300041.jpg,"Trial by Fire: The Hundred Years War, Volume 2",Jonathan Sumption,9780571207374,"['History', 'Medieval History', 'Medieval', 'War', 'Military History', 'Nonfiction', 'European History']"

As El-Gabalawy notes in his critical introduction, the novella is ""based on the pattern of Boccaccio's Decameron, which begins with the flight of ten people from plague-stricken Florence"" . Elkhadem's protagonists, seven men and three women, happen to meet in a visa office as they attempt to flee from the endemic oppression and brutality that plagues Egypt under Nasser's tyrannical regime. The range of characters--an engineering student, a teacher of French, a young bride, a businessman, a journalist, an actress, a naive young man, an academic, a housewife, and a commander of a military prison--creates a cross section of Egyptian society. These men and women chat about themselves as they wait to receive their exit visas, just as Boccaccio's characters recount tales to pass time. However, the autobiographical stories presented in The Plague, unlike the tales of the Decameron or the recollections of Elkhadem's protagonists in From Travels of the Egyptian Odysseus and Ulysses's Hallucinations or the Like, are told before, not after, the characters leave their homeland. Thus, hope, anxiety, and fear pervade and infect the speeches and thoughts of Elkhadem's most recent protagonists as they anticipate the prospects of self-imposed exile.",York Press Ltd,36.0,1989.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28821541-the-plague,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1455466406m/28821541.jpg,The Plague,Saad Elkhadem,091996673X,['Literature']

Twelve years after the devastating loss of their dearest friend Emily, they find themselves still affected by the trauma.
Abigail, married and newly pregnant, helps others through her work for the Department of Children and Families. When a new client with epilepsy unexpectedly forces her to re-examine the past, Abigail realizes she's the one who needs saving. Stephen has struggled emotionally, physically and spiritually after losing the love of his life, and the long-term effects of his grief have kept him from truly living and finding love again.
As the two search for redemption and the power to heal, their paths cross once again. Emily's presence so long ago still has meaning in their own lives, teaching them the meaning of true friendship and what's really important. Drawing on her own experience with a close friend with epilepsy who died, author Laurie Bellesheim raises awareness about the disease in this compelling tale told partially through flashbacks.
Laurie Bellesheim, a published poet, belongs to several writers' organizations including Writer's Digest, Authors Den and Writing.com.

220,515,eng,3.33,"In this inventive mix of criticism, scholarship, and personal reflection, Carrie J. Preston explores the nature of cross-cultural teaching, learning, and performance. Throughout the twentieth century, Japanese noh was a major creative catalyst for American and European writers, dancers, and composers. The noh theater's stylized choreography, poetic chant, spectacular costumes and masks, and engagement with history inspired Western artists as they reimagined new approaches to tradition and form. In Learning to Kneel, Preston locates noh's important influence on such canonical figures as Pound, Yeats, Brecht, Britten, and Beckett. These writers learned about noh from an international cast of collaborators, and Preston traces the ways in which Japanese and Western artists influenced one another.
Preston's critical work was profoundly shaped by her own training in noh performance technique under a professional actor in Tokyo, who taught her to kneel, bow, chant, and submit to the teachings of a conservative tradition. This encounter challenged Preston's assumptions about effective teaching, particularly her inclinations to emphasize Western ideas of innovation and subversion and to overlook the complex ranges of agency experienced by teachers and students. It also inspired new perspectives regarding the generative relationship between Western writers and Japanese performers. Pound, Yeats, Brecht, and others are often criticized for their orientalist tendencies and misappropriation of noh, but Preston's analysis and her journey reflect a more nuanced understanding of cultural exchange.",Columbia University Press,369.0,2016.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27917540-learning-to-kneel,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468231642m/27917540.jpg,"Learning to Kneel: Noh, Modernism, and Journeys in Teaching",Carrie J.

Enoch Wallace is not like other humans. Living a secluded life in the backwoods of Wisconsin, he carries a nineteenth-century rifle and never seems to age--a fact that has recently caught the attention of prying government eyes. The truth is, Enoch is the last surviving veteran of the American Civil War and, for close to a century, he has operated a secret way station for aliens passing through on journeys to other stars. But the gifts of knowledge and immortality that his intergalactic guests have bestowed upon him are proving to be a nightmarish burden, for they have opened Enoch's eyes to humanity's impending destruction.

What is truth? Is it knowable?
Can we be absolutely certain about anything?
A momentous work of philosophy doesn't have to be massive and unreadable. No example of philosophy that you'll encounter will deal with Certainty and Truth more concisely and compellingly than this book, yet it does so while maintaining an engaging style that keeps the cerebral content very readable and accessible. Like previous philosophies that address Certainty and Truth, the work HAD to address the issue of God, yet unlike it's predecessors, manages to do so without any hidden assumptions. As a result, it holds confirmations of orthodox Christianity that are unprecedented.
The book adopts a partially autobiographical style as it details how the hyper-rational author went from the purest form of agnosticism to fundamentalist Christianity over a span of years. Within are essays that address common misconceptions that skeptics and Christians share. There is also a miraculous quality to the account that speaks to the heart.
The fact that the author is a recent stroke victim, cognitively impaired and partially paralyzed, makes it more apparent that he cannot take credit for any cleverness reflected in this book. There are things on a par with Einstein's ""On The Photoelectric Effect"" or ""On Brownian Motion"" Since the author admits to having the barest of math abilities, it's fortunate that the issues in this work do not require the same mathematical rigor to express as Einstein's remarkable understandings.

233,542,eng,4.88,"The characters in God in Neon are linked not only by the characters dependence on alcohol, but at times also by geographical location. These characters exist on the fringes of normal society. What is normal for them--using a bungee cord to tie an invalid father to a window in order to go drinking, engaging in an extreme competition to settle a bet for a classic Camaro, burning up a bar after being told that to have another drink would certify death, et cetera--would be appalling to most. It is in these appalling moments that the stories find the most traction. They scrape the bottom of the barrel of humanity and transform it, and readers watch as the characters struggle with those transformations and failed attempts. In the end, while the individual characters may not find some ultimate resolution for their vices, readers are left with a sense of completion as they watch the bar they've seen in multiple stories go up in flames. Later in the collection, the characters experience similar downfalls, but elsewhere, showing how similar we all really are when our backs are against the wall and alcohol seems like the only option.
The collection speaks to the Grit aesthetic of writers like Harry Crews and Barry Hannah. Readers of contemporary Southern fiction would find these stories appealing for their characters and the depravity that some sink into just to get their fix.

237,555,eng,3.47,"A psychological thriller in the tradition of Patricia Highsmith about two couples caught in a web of conflicting passions while deep-sea diving off the beautiful Canary Islands
In the late 1990s, Sven Fiedler and his girlfriend, Antje, left Germany for the island of Lanzarote, rejecting what Sven considered a vulgar culture of materialism and judgment. The young couple set up a diving service catering to tourists eager to bask in the warm sunshine and explore the silent, gleaming marine paradise that makes this otherwise barren volcanic island such a remarkable retreat. Sven's approach was simple: take the mechanics of diving seriously, instruct his clients clearly, and stay out of their personal business as best he can.
And life on the island goes smoothly until two German tourists--Jola von der Pahlen, a daytime soap star on the verge of cinematic success, and Theo Hast, a stalled novelist--engage Sven for a high-priced, intensive two-week diving experience. Staying in a guest house on Sven and Antje's property, the two visitors and their hosts quickly become embroiled in a tangle of jealousy and suspicion.
Sven is struck by Jola's beauty, her evident wealth, and her apparently volatile relationship with the much older Theo. Theo quickly leaps to the conclusion that Sven and Jola are having an affair, but, oddly, he seems to facilitate it rather than trying to intervene. Antje, looking on, grows increasingly wary of these particular clients.
As the point of view shifts from one character to the next, the reader is constantly kept guessing about who knows what, and, more important, who is telling the truth.

Aloysius, the magical black cat and powerful witch's familiar, isn't afraid to go into battle to protect his master, but the outcome of the fight turns his feline world upside down. A direct hit of magic steals not only his memories and power, but even the body he's lived in for several centuries. When he wakes up naked on the floor of a veterinarian's office, it isn't as the cat Aloysius, but as the sixteenth-century French gentleman Alain Bellarose. And when Alain sees sexy and enigmatic veterinarian Luke Elliott, he decides he'll make the best of his time as a human.
Luke is a man with secrets who generally prefers the company of animals--though the flamboyant boy who washes his face with the side of his hand and tries to lick his own privates might prove an exception.
Meanwhile, Witch Master Killian Barth and his secret weapon, Sammy, struggle without Aloysius's power to draw on. Two evil females are circling, and seeing the coven's weakness, they're about to move in for the kill. When Alain's memories return, he's faced with the ultimate dilemma: protect his community or stay with the man he loves.

For many years epilepsy was associated with mental illness or even possession by devils. People with epilepsy were forbidden to marry or have children. Many became victims of Nazi eugenics programmes. To this day many people with epilepsy - sixty million worldwide - still live in fear of exposure.
Grant's book traces the history of the condition and the pioneering doctors whose extraordinary breakthroughs finally helped gain an understanding of how the brain works.

There he fought the war from the command cupola of an M48 Patton tank, an experience far removed from the stereotypical grunt in the rice paddies. The M48 was fifty-two tons of hell on wheels, equipped with a .50-caliber machine gun and a 90mm main gun, and Birdwell's hard-charging unit was responsible for securing the main supply route between Saigon and Tay Ninh. After extensive interviews with Birdwell, acclaimed Vietnam War historian Keith William Nolan transports the reader to the confident days of 1967 when Dwight Birdwell, then nineteen years old and raring for a fight, was first assigned to Troop C 3d Squadron, 4th Cavalry (25th Division) - a time when there really seemed to be a light shining at the end of the tunnel. Then came the Tet offensive and everything changed. Birdwell won the Silver Star and Purple Heart on January 31, 1968, when the tanks and armored personnel carriers of C/3/4th Cav smashed headlong into the communist regiment that had broken through the wire at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. Tet was an allied victory. The decimated Viet Cong, reinforced by North Vietnamese Army regulars, refused to admit it though. Birdwell was wounded two more times, and won a second Silver Star in a little battle-wrecked hamlet called An Duc on the Fourth of July 1968. The pressure was relentless. Demoralized by heavy losses and the realization that the politicians and generals didn't really know how to win the war, the only goal for many of the troops became survival.

278,643,eng,4.14,"Alan Turing was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. In 1935, aged 22, he developed the mathematical theory upon which all subsequent stored-program digital computers are modeled.
At the outbreak of hostilities with Germany in September 1939, he joined the Government Codebreaking team at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire and played a crucial role in deciphering Engima, the code used by the German armed forces to protect their radio communications. Turing's work on the version of Enigma used by the German navy was vital to the battle for supremacy in the North Atlantic. He also contributed to the attack on the cyphers known as ""Fish,"" which were used by the German High Command for the encryption of signals during the latter part of the war. His contribution helped to shorten the war in Europe by an estimated two years.
After the war, his theoretical work led to the development of Britain's first computers at the National Physical Laboratory and the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University.
Turing was also a founding father of modern cognitive science, theorizing that the cortex at birth is an ""unorganized machine"" which through ""training"" becomes organized ""into a universal machine or something like it."" He went on to develop the use of computers to model biological growth, launching the discipline now referred to as Artificial Life.
The papers in this book are the key works for understanding Turing's phenomenal contribution across all these fields. The collection includes Turing's declassified wartime ""Treatise on the Enigma""; letters from Turing to Churchill and to codebreakers; lectures, papers, and broadcasts which opened up the concept of AI and its implications; and the paper which formed the genesis of the investigation of Artifical Life.",Oxford University Press (UK),622.0,2013.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150734.The_Essential_Turing,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,"The Essential Turing: Seminal Writings in Computing, Logic, Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Life Plus the Secrets of Eni",Alan Turing,9780198250807,"['Science', 'Computer Science', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Nonfiction', 'Logic', 'Technology']"

How much heartbreak can one heart take?
Melisa Dane has made it through the worst. Her heart was broken, but Florian Dane, better known as ""Heat""--and the man of her dreams--returned to mend it. Now, with her family almost complete, Melisa is ready to sit back and enjoy life.
But fate isn't done with her yet. The perpetual smile on her face freezes when the second man to steal her heart shows up in her life once again. Scott Bergfeld, the husband she buried and grieved for years ago, is not dead, and he comes back bearing secrets.

It features Annie Gomez and her ""coterie"" of fellow outcasts. Annie Gomez, having just completed 10th grade, wrestles with being the smartest person she knows (and probably the smartest person ever) and yet having to deal with absurd parents, thick classmates, and saving the world from aliens (or possibly fairies.) Fortunately, Annie isn't quite totally alone. Her circle of carefully chosen friends include Andy, half Inuit, half African-American, who once played Anne Frank on stage; Johnny, a shy Romany boy who loves history; Naomi, a sophisticated, mature woman of the world (ok, 16 year old of the world); Justin, who still looks like a 6th grader (and a golden retriever) but plays trombone with a world-class jazz band and is the high schools leading expert in exobiology - the study of alien life; and finally Aaron, whose brilliant mind is beyond the ken of ordinary humans. Aaron is autistic, rarely speaks, and spends his time in realms that are imaginary. Or are they? On the last day of the school year Annie's biology teacher warns her that he believes aliens are trying to take over her mind. ""Why not?"" she shrugs. ""Everyone else is."" Yet as she continues to lose her grip on reality over the next weeks, she has no choice but to accept the possibility. As events unfold, Annie finds that not one but two different alien races are trying to contact her. One is trying to help. One is trying to destroy humanity. But which is which? Feeling totally helpless for the first time in her life, Annie is pulled first by one and then the other into strange and dangerous landscapes. And her friends (except Aaron, mysteriously disappears) are pulled with her, which is probably a good thing, she figures. A fortune teller told her that she had to learn to trust others (""yeah, right"") but that in the end she would have to depend on her own resources (""hey, can't someone help me out here?""). At the last minute she makes her final effort, deploying her secret weapon, only to be used when there are no other options. And it fails. With no hope left she finds herself locked in mortal, hand-to-hand combat with a terrifying, powerful alien, a battle that will determine whether humanity survives. Her strength failing, she faces the very real probability of her own death and please don't tell this to ANYONE but she realizes she really loves her parents. Will she prevail at the last minute?

* All Random House Large Print editions are published in a 16-point typeface
Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty,early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.
It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the ""soul of pampered self-absorption""; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story is a sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city is certain to become a modern classic.

287,669,eng,4.06,"From bestselling author Jon Krakauer, a stark, powerful, meticulously reported narrative about a series of sexual assaults at the University of Montana -- stories that illuminate the human drama behind the national plague of campus rape
Missoula, Montana, is a typical college town, with a highly regarded state university, bucolic surroundings, a lively social scene, and an excellent football team --the Grizzlies --with a rabid fan base.
The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. Few of these assaults were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical.
A DOJ report released in December of 2014 estimates 110,000 women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four are raped each year. Krakauer's devastating narrative of what happened in Missoula makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault.
Acquaintance rape is a crime like no other. Unlike burglary or embezzlement or any other felony, the victim often comes under more suspicion than the alleged perpetrator. This is especially true if the victim is sexually active; if she had been drinking prior to the assault -- and if the man she accuses plays on a popular sports team. The vanishingly small but highly publicized incidents of false accusations are often used to dismiss her claims in the press. If the case goes to trial, the woman's entire personal life becomes fair game for defense attorneys.
This brutal reality goes a long way towards explaining why acquaintance rape is the most underreported crime in America. In addition to physical trauma, its victims often suffer devastating psychological damage that leads to feelings of shame, emotional paralysis and stigmatization. PTSD rates for rape victims are estimated to be 50%, higher than soldiers returning from war.
In Missoula, Krakauer chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula -- the nights when they were raped; their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the way they were treated by the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys; the public vilification and private anguish; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them.
Some of them went to the police. Some declined to go to the police, or to press charges, but sought redress from the university, which has its own, non-criminal judicial process when a student is accused of rape. In two cases the police agreed to press charges and the district attorney agreed to prosecute. One case led to a conviction; one to an acquittal. Those women courageous enough to press charges or to speak publicly about their experiences were attacked in the media, on Grizzly football fan sites, and/or to their faces. The university expelled three of the accused rapists, but one was reinstated by state officials in a secret proceeding. One district attorney testified for an alleged rapist at his university hearing. She later left the prosecutor's office and successfully defended the Grizzlies' star quarterback in his rape trial. The horror of being raped, in each woman's case, was magnified by the mechanics of the justice system and the reaction of the community.
Krakauer's dispassionate, carefully documented account of what these women endured cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape. College-age women are not raped because they are promiscuous, or drunk, or send mixed signals, or feel guilty about casual sex, or seek attention. They are the victims of a terrible crime and deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken.",Doubleday,384.0,2015.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25430260-missoula,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442384735m/25430260.jpg,Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town,Jon Krakauer,9780385538749,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Feminism', 'Crime', 'History', 'Politics']"

While checking into her hotel, the woman is robbed of her wallet and passport - all of her money and identification. Though the police investigate, the woman senses an undercurrent of complicity between the hotel staff and the authorities - she knows she'll never recover her possessions. Stripped of her identity, she feels burdened by the crime yet strangely liberated by her sudden freedom to be anyone she chooses.
A chance encounter with a movie producer leads to a job posing as a stand-in for a well-known film star. The star reels her in deeper, though, and soon she's inhabiting the actress's skin off set, too - going deeper into the Casablancan night and further from herself. And so continues a strange and breathtaking journey full of unexpected turns, an adventure in which the woman finds herself moving further and further away from the person she once was.
Told with vibrant, lush detail and a wicked sense of humor, The Diver's Clothes Lie Empty is part literary mystery, part psychological thriller - an unforgettable novel that explores free will, power, and a woman's right to choose not her past, perhaps not her present, but certainly her future. This is Vendela Vida's most assured and ambitious novel yet.",Atlantic,260.0,2015.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26804808-the-diver-s-empty-clothes,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1443031255m/26804808.jpg,The Diver's Empty Clothes,Vendela Vida,9781782397700,"['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Travel', 'Africa', 'Literary Fiction', 'Morocco', 'Contemporary']"

As she helps a man from Kosovo whose wife disappeared during the war there, she is confronted with the gruesome results of the work of forensic archaeologists, medics and anthropologists. She is gradually drawn into the fate of her client on a more personal level and eventually accompanies him to Kosovo, where she sees the results of the conflict at first hand. --

Drawing on archeological findings, previously published only in Chinese, indicating how the I Ching was actually used by those who created it, and motivated by a lifetime of personal use and fascination, Kerson Huang has created a new translation of great significance.
Restoring the I Ching to its original form, Huang underscores its first use as a practical oracle by Chinese farmers. His translation beautifully preserves the starkly poetic voice of the original, while his comments clearly and simply explain the images and detail the historical references buried within the verse. Huang reveals the I Ching as an epic poem equivalent to The Iliadand The Odyssey--one hexagram recalls the dethroning of Feng Feng; a series of lines portray Wang Hai, one of the three High Ancestors of the Shang dynasty; a third contains a sage proclamation of Lord Tang.
Each hexagram and its corresponding interpretation is presented on a two-page spread, making this version unusually easy to use and understand. Introductory chapters detail the evolution of the I Ching, from the philosophical reinterpretations of Confucius to the modern musings of Carl Jung, and clearly explain both the coin method and yarrow-stalk method for consulting the oracle.

It has been used and abused in academia by proponents of opposing political views. Multiculturalism has appropriated it, as have postmodernism and postcommunism. It is used pejoratively to refer to excessive specialization and nostalgically to refer to Europe's lost people -- its wild warriors and passionate geniuses. This book explores the idea of the Balkan as metaphor and the meaning of Balkan identity in the context of contemporary culture. Focusing on Balkanism both as a body of knowledge and as the critical study of that discourse, this book does for the Balkans what Edward Said's Orientalism did for ""the Orient.""The sixteen authors, most of whom were born and educated in the Balkans, apply the Western academic tools of postmodernism, poststructuralism, deconstruction, psychoanalysis, and critical multiculturalism to topics as varied as the rhetoric of Balkanization, the war in Kosovo, Western demonization and erotization of the Serbs, Balkan film, human rights legislation, Byzantinism, the vampire as an image of Balkan violence, envy of the political and moral capital of victimhood, the tendency of the Balkan psyche toward depression, Serbian machismo and homosexuality, and wartime rape.

352,804,eng,4.44,"A work of speculative historical fiction that depicts the lives of Thelonious Monk and his wife, Nellie, Joe Milazzo's Crepuscule W/ Nellie does not attempt historical accuracy. Neither is it an ekphrastic experiment meant to mimic Monk's brilliance, with his signature dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists. Instead, much like Monk's composing, Crepuscule W/ Nellie creates a whole new architecture in which to tell its story.
Steve Erickson (Zeroville, Our Ecstatic Days) on Joe Milazzo:
""The challenge in writing on behalf of Joe Milazzo's fiction is finding the language to convey how special it is, but let us begin with audacious and fearless, lyrical and brilliant, superbly imaginative and assuredly accomplished--one of tomorrow's great novelists on the cusp of his moment.""
Claire Donato (Burial) on Crepuscule W/ Nellie:
""A polyvocal narrative that's part Faulkner a la midcentury Manhattan's jazz epicenters, part early 90's avant-pop crossed with Black Mountain poetics, and part ghost, Joe Milazzo's genrebending Crepuscule W/ Nellie boldly re-imagines the relationship between fact and fiction.""
Douglas Kearney (The Black Automaton, PATTER) on Crepuscule W/ Nellie:
""Milazzo dug this lost recording of the Monk/Monk/Pannonica trio--dug as in figured, as in got into, as in exhumed--out that 'dustbin' folks talk about. And since the composition called Crepuscule w/Nellie is this time a story storying history, the good mess Milazzo so expertly messes with alchemizes the linguistic odds-and-ends that make a vernacular both high-falluting and low-down; the factual scraps that member a fiction into a rich speculation; and the individuals ignored so long they must come back to us in books. Our author has given us a fascinating one. Dig it, dig it, dig it.""
Sesshu Foster (World Ball Notebook, Atomik Aztex) on Crepuscule W/ Nellie:
""Joe Milazzo's Crepuscule w/Nellie is a blast. So rarely do we get a novel this momentous, challenging, ambitious--Crepuscule w/ Nellie transcends expectation. I'm moved by the fierce acuity of the maximalist prose, never less than adroit and vital as it parses a famous triangle between the maestro, Thelonious Monk, his wife Nellie, and the Bebop Baroness, Pannonica de Koenigswarter, the most storied music patron of the 20th century. Triangulating the infinite personal declensions between struggling black musicians and the white patrons, between the women and their men, Joe Milazzo's language brilliantly echolocates that essentially American distance, sounding out an American loneliness that is with us still.""
Joseph McElroy (Cannonball, Women and Men) on Crepuscule W/ Nellie:
""Joe Milazzo's Crepuscule W/ Nellie takes as its great and original subject a care-giver's, literally home-maker's immensely improvising relation to a creative genius, a demanding, needy, powerful, enigmatic, often disappointing man who was her husband. That is what this long, intimate, painfully American, many-voiced rumination of a novel is about - though also, and indirectly, about much that is implied by its title, which was first that of Thelonious Monk's shortest major composition, one of my favorites, with its outer, measured clarity and inner, off-balance infinities and shadows. Has Milazzo added the lyrics? I think rather that he has written a deep, interior book about lives that included jazz and everything else. A book that will last.""

The Chronicles follow the intrigues of ambition and love in the cathedral town of Barchester. Trollope was of course interested in the Church, that pillar of Victorian society - in its susceptibility to corruption, hypocrisy, and blinkered conservatism - but the Barsetshire novels are no more ecclesiastical' than his Palliser novels are political'. It is the behavior of the individuals within a power structure that interests him. In this novel Trollope continues the story of Mr. Harding and his daughter Eleanor, adding to his cast of characters that oily symbol of progress Mr. Slope, the hen-pecked Dr. Proudie, and the amiable and breezy Stanhope family. The central questions of this moral comedy - Who will be warden? Who will be dean? Who will marry Eleanor? - are skillfully handled with that subtlety of ironic observation that has won Trollope such a wide and appreciative readership.

One of the main topics of cultural conversation during the last decade was the supposed ""fertility crisis,"" and whether modern women could figure out a way to way to have it all--a successful, demanding career and the required 2.3 children--before their biological clock stopped ticking. Now, however, conversation has turned to whether it's necessary to have it all or, perhaps more controversial, whether children are really a requirement for a fulfilling life. The idea that some women and men prefer not to have children is often met with sharp criticism and incredulity by the public and mainstream media.
In this provocative and controversial collection of essays, curated by writer Meghan Daum, sixteen acclaimed writers explain why they have chosen to eschew parenthood. Contributors Lionel Shriver, Sigrid Nunez, Kate Christiensen, Elliott Holt, Geoff Dyer, and Tim Kreider, among others, offer a unique perspective on the overwhelming cultural pressure of parenthood.

It's a book with historical depth by an author as interested in exploring the philosophy of his world as its violent, conflicted politics. The novel begins a bit slowly as we're introduced to the characters and the world they live in. There's Kellhus, a warrior-monk from a city hidden away for 2000 years, and Achamian, a sorcerer and spy from the Mandate school, whose members all have recurring nightmares of an ancient war. There's an emperor who longs for godhood, a barbarian warlord, and assorted other schemers. And lingering in the background is something truly evil.
When a newly arisen leader declares Holy War, the story brings everyone together. From that moment, the narrative takes off, and Bakker's prose carries the story right along. There's a fair amount of graphic violence, broken up by occasional flashes of humour. Bakker is working a combination that's currently also being explored by Steven Erikson and Sean McMullen: big fantasy worlds with long, deep histories, and characters who can think as well as act.

The child born of that labor, Macon (Milkman) Dead, will eventually come to discover, through his complicated progress to maturity, the meaning of the drama that marked his birth.

In other words, these are stories of cultural encounters.
The title story is about Mrs. Nagai, an elderly and amicable Japanese woman whose husband was an ex-Japanese soldier during the Second World War. It incorporates conflicting narratives of the war, without tilting to any one side, but it is through Mrs. Nagai's character that readers see the war in a new light. In 'Pepsi', a culturally alienated Bangladeshi girl whose father is a diplomat in Ethiopia spends time with a bunch of poor kids living across the street only to see them evicted as a consequence of this friendship. 'Raisins not Virgins' is a witty love story that pivots around a Bangladeshi American couple in New York City. While the man stands vehemently against repressive US policies against Muslims the world over, the woman reprimands conservative Islamic ideologies. 'Alexander Detained' is particularly important for it shows what it means to be a Muslim in the US following the 9/11 attacks and imagines a dystopia that is not so outlandish.

Anyone interested in social movements, feminism in the Cold War, and the genderings of political violence will have their minds opened by reading this book.""--Cynthia Enloe, author of Seriously! Investigating Crashes and Crises as if Women Mattered
In the early 1970s, a number of West German left-wing activists took up arms, believing that revolution would lead to social change. In the years to come, the bombings, shootings, kidnappings and bank robberies of the Red Army Faction (RAF) and Movement 2nd June dominated newspaper headlines and polarized legislative debates. Half of the terrorists declaring war on the West German state were women who understood their violent political actions to be part of their liberation from restrictive gender norms. As women participating in a brand of systematic violence usually associated with masculinity, they presented a cultural paradox, and their political decisions were viewed as gender transgressions by the state, the public, and even the burgeoning women's movement, which considered violence as patriarchal and unfeminist.
Death in the Shape of a Young Girl questions this separation of political violence from feminist politics and offers a new understanding of left-wing female terrorists' actions as feminist practices that challenged existing gender ideologies. Patricia Melzer draws on archival sources, unpublished letters, and interviews with former activists to paint a fresh and interdisciplinary picture of West Germany's most notorious political group, from feminist responses to sexist media coverage of female terrorists to the gendered nature of their infamous hunger strikes while in prison. Placing the controversial actions of the Red Army Faction into the context of feminist politics, Death in the Shape of a Young Girl offers an innovative and engaging cultural history that foregrounds how gender shapes our perception of women's political choices and of any kind of political violence.",NYU Press,352.0,2015.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24339398-death-in-the-shape-of-a-young-girl,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420623624m/24339398.jpg,Death in the Shape of a Young Girl: Women's Political Violence in the Red Army Faction,Patricia Melzer,9781479864072,"['Politics', 'History']"

Moving to a space station at the edge of the galaxy was always going to be the death of Hanna's social life. Nobody said it might actually get her killed.
The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller Illuminaecontinues on board the Jump Station Heimdall, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.
Hanna is the station captain's pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy's most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the Hypatiaare headed right toward Heimdall, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.
When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station's wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren't just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the Hypatia--and possibly the known universe--is in their hands.
But relax. They've totally got this. They hope.

453,1016,eng,3.9,"In this remarkably original work of political philosophy, one of today's foremost feminist theorist challenges the way contemporary society functions by questioning the standard interpretation of an idea that is deeply embedded in American and British political thought: that our rights and freedoms derive from the social contract explicated by Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau and interpreted in the United States by the Founding Fathers.
The author shows how we are told only half the story of the original contract that establishes modern patriarchy. The sexual contract is ignored and thus men's patriarchal right over women is also glossed over. No attention is paid to the problems that arise when women are excluded from the original contract but incorporated into the new contractual order.
One of the main targets of the book is those who try to turn contractarian theory to progressive use, and a major thesis of the book is that this is not possible. Thus those feminists who have looked to a more ""proper"" contract- one between genuinely equal partners, or one entered into without any coercion- are misleading themselves. In the author's words, ""In contract theory universal freedom is always a hypothesis, a story, a political fiction. Contract always generates political right in the forms of domination and subordination."" Thus the book is also aimed at mainstream political theorists, and socialist and other critics of contract theory.
The author offers a sweeping challenge to conventional understandings- of both left and right- of actual contracts in everyday life: the marriage contract, the employment contract, the prostitution contract, and the new surrogate mother contract. By bringing a feminist perspective to bear on the contradictions and paradoxes surrounding women and contract, and the relation between the sexes, she is able to shed new light on fundamental political problems of freedom and subordination.",Stanford University Press,276.0,1988.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/912993.The_Sexual_Contract,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407812238m/912993.jpg,The Sexual Contract,Carole Pateman,9780804714778,"['Feminism', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Gender', 'Theory', 'Sociology']"

Some have achieved status as religious, cultural, or national symbols.

The author also pays homage to particular trees, such as the fabled Ankerwyke Yew, under which Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn, and the spectacular cherry trees of Washington, D.C.

It was the worst school massacre in our nation's history. Can we prevent a tragedy like this from happening again?
In Elliot Aronson's Nobody Left to Hate, on of our nation's leading social psychologists argues that the negative atmosphere in our schools--the exclusion, taunting, humiliation, and bullying--played a major role in triggering the pathological behavior of the shooters. At the very least, such an atmosphere makes schools an unpleasant experience for most normal students.
But it doesn't have to be. Nobody Left to Hateoffers concise, practical, and easy-to-apply strategies for creating a more supportive, stimulating, and compassionate environment in our schools. Based on decades of scientific research and classroom testing, these strategies explain how students can be taught to control their own impulses, how to respect others, and how to resolve conflicts amicably. In addition, they show teachers how to structure classes to promote cooperation, rather than competition, without sacrificing academics. On the contrary, education is greatly enhanced.

532,1204,eng,3.78,"Shojo manga are romance comics for teenage girls. Characterized by a very dense visual style, featuring flowery backgrounds and big-eyed, androgynous boys and girls, it is an extremely popular and prominent genre in Japan. Why is this genre so appealing? Where did it come from? Why do so many of the stories feature androgynous characters and homosexual romance?
Passionate Friendshipanswers these questions by reviewing Japanese girls' print culture from its origins in 1920s and 1930s girls' literary magazines to the 1970s ""revolution"" shojo manga, when young women artists took over the genre. It looks at the narrative and aesthetic features of girls' literature and illustration across the twentieth century, both pre- and postwar, and discusses how these texts addressed and formed a reading community of girls, even as they were informed by competing political and social ideologies.
The author traces the development of girls' culture in pre-World War II magazines and links it to postwar teenage girls' comics and popular culture. Within this culture, as private and cloistered as the schools most readers attended, a discourse of girlhood arose that avoided heterosexual romance in favor of ""S relationships,"" passionate friendships between girls. This preference for homogeneity is echoed in the postwar genre of boys' love manga written for girls. Both prewar S relationships and postwar boys' love stories gave girls a protected space to develop and explore their identities and sexuality apart from the pressures of a patriarchal society. Shojo manga offered to a reading community of girls a place to share the difficulties of adolescence as well as an alternative to the image of girls purveyed by the media to boys and men.",University of Hawaii Press,208.0,2012.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13798472-passionate-friendship,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1476724805m/13798472.jpg,Passionate Friendship: The Aesthetics of Girls' Culture in Japan,Deborah Shamoon,9780824836382,"['Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'Manga', 'Feminism', 'Queer']"

The creeks, tide pools, and rocky islands are her haunts and her hiding grounds, and she is known to wander for miles. But while her physical world is expansive, her personal one is small and treacherous: Turtle has grown up isolated since the death of her mother, in the thrall of her tortured and charismatic father, Martin. Her social existence is confined to the middle school (where she fends off the interest of anyone, student or teacher, who might penetrate her shell) and to her life with her father.
Then Turtle meets Jacob, a high-school boy who tells jokes, lives in a big clean house, and looks at Turtle as if she is the sunrise. And for the first time, the larger world begins to come into focus: her life with Martin is neither safe nor sustainable. Motivated by her first experience with real friendship and a teenage crush, Turtle starts to imagine escape, using the very survival skills her father devoted himself to teaching her. What follows is a harrowing story of bravery and redemption. With Turtle's escalating acts of physical and emotional courage, the reader watches, heart in throat, as this teenage girl struggles to become her own hero--and in the process, becomes ours as well.

Through eye-opening research and gripping stories of his own patients and family, Gawande reveals the suffering this dynamic has produced. Nursing homes, devoted above all to safety, battle with residents over the food they are allowed to eat and the choices they are allowed to make. Doctors, uncomfortable discussing patients' anxieties about death, fall back on false hopes and treatments that are actually shortening lives instead of improving them. And families go along with all of it.
In his bestselling books, Atul Gawande, a practicing surgeon, has fearlessly revealed the struggles of his profession. Now he examines its ultimate limitations and failures--in his own practices as well as others'--as life draws to a close. And he discovers how we can do better. He follows a hospice nurse on her rounds, a geriatrician in his clinic, and reformers turning nursing homes upside down. He finds people who show us how to have the hard conversations and how to ensure we never sacrifice what people really care about.
Riveting, honest, and humane, Being Mortal shows that the ultimate goal is not a good death but a good life--all the way to the very end.

The daughter of Sasha's overbearing sister, Gabi is a grad student at Socorro's New Mexico Tech, where she's studying explosives technology. In town to help boost area tourism, Sasha looks forward to spending time with the young woman. But the PR pro never imagined it would be in the hospital, where Gabi lands after someone rigs her mailbox with a nasty surprise.
Jewish with an Iranian surname, Gabi could be the victim of a hate crime. But as details emerge about her work and personal relationships, she begins to appear less as a victim than as a threat. Meanwhile, Sasha learns that the family of her client, town patriarch Papi Sanchez, is riddled with secrets and scandal.
At once a topically flavored whodunit and a realistic portrayal of the way families join together--or don't--in a crisis, The Socorro Blastis a blend of mystery and domestic drama, with the flawed but always engaging Sasha Solomon on center stage.

The twenty-seven-year-old lieutenant colonel departed for the stars from within the shadowy world of the Soviet military-industrial complex. Barbed wires, no-entry placards, armed guards, false identities, mendacious maps, and a myriad of secret signs had hidden Gagarin from prying outsiders--not even his friends or family knew what he had been up to. Coming less than four years after the Russians launched Sputnik into orbit, Gagarin's voyage was cause for another round of capitalist shock and Soviet rejoicing.
The Cosmonaut Who Couldn't Stop Smilingrelates this twentieth-century icon's remarkable life while exploring the fascinating world of Soviet culture. Gagarin's flight brought him massive international fame--in the early 1960s, he was possibly the most photographed person in the world, flashing his trademark smile while rubbing elbows with the varied likes of Nehru, Castro, Queen Elizabeth II, and Italian sex symbol Gina Lollobrigida. Outside of the spotlight, Andrew L. Jenks reveals, his tragic and mysterious death in a jet crash became fodder for morality tales and conspiracy theories in his home country, and, long after his demise, his life continues to provide grist for the Russian popular-culture mill.
This is the story of a legend, both the official one and the one of myth, which reflected the fantasies, perversions, hopes and dreams of Gagarin's fellow Russians.

Then one cold and rainy night, everything changes. Joel's life is turned upside down when he becomes a full-time dad to Evie, and his previously carefree relationship with Dan cracks under the strain.

618,1387,eng,4.12,"Few artists of the late nineteenth century produced an oeuvre more bizarre, ironic, profound and rich in interpretive possibilities than the Belgian painter James Ensor. Ensor lived from 1860 until 1949, and has enjoyed newfound fame since 1994 as the subject of the They Might Be Giants song ""Meet James Ensor."" His unusual work challenged standards of taste and technique by mingling the influence of his Belgian forbears, Bosch and Breugel, with a bright, loosely brushed impressionist style. Ensor offered unmistakable symbols of the absurdity of existence--particularly in portraying the tourists who flooded his native Ostend on their vacations, whom he caricatured mercilessly as clowns and skeletons, or concealed behind brightly colored carnival masks. His painting influenced both German Expressionists and French Surrealists. When seen in the light of new trends towards the grotesque and comic in contemporary painting, his work obtains new currency. ""James Ensor"" includes some eighty masterpieces on canvas and sixty works on paper from international museums and private collections, with key pieces from each of his creative periods. Particular attention is paid to his late work, long neglected by scholarship, in order to prepare the ground for a re-evaluation.",Hatje Cantz,331.0,2006.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1160558.James_Ensor,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,James Ensor,Ingrid Pfeiffer,9783775717038,"['Art', 'Nonfiction']"

620,1389,eng,5.0,"There was scheduled yet another meeting for home owners at The Oaks. I thought it would be just another boring business meeting, but Laura seemed eager to go.
Laura wore an outfit that she bought. The outfit turned out to be a stroke of genius. It showed as a see through dress over a short, opaque slip. There were also seamed opera length nylons with garters. There was a space between the bottom of the slip and the top of the nylons. It was attention getting but really not all that revealing or daring. However, it was something that Laura would never have dreamed of wearing back home. The outfit turned out to be the first small step for a new Laura.
When we got to the meeting, it turned out that Laura was wearing more than any of the other ladies. The most any other lady wore was a short, plunge neckline silk dress over nothing and there were also some braless see through blouses. I liked the view, but was a bit shocked when Laura went into the bathroom and removed her slip and then returned with her see through dress over a fancy lace bra, garter belt and panty set. I had never before known Laura to wear anything but pantyhose.
With Laura's ample tits, covered with nothing but some peekaboo lace, she received many admiring glances from the males. I could tell that my wife really liked the attention. More to my surprise, Laura also walked home from the meeting, without wearing the slip. We discussed her outfit when we got home and Laura told me that she wanted to wear something with the same kind of flair that the rest of the ladies were wearing. Laura told me she liked the attention and that I should be prepared for more changes. I knew that Laura liked the attention, as I had to fuck her to scrape her off the ceiling.
We then attended several more get togethers over the following weeks. Laura used the same outfit for the get togethers, but not in the same way. The second time, Laura wore the slip, sans see through dress and bra. (Laura provided a jiggle show, but some of the other ladies were essentially topless.) The next time Laura wore the see through dress, sans bra and slip. (The other ladies were also braless, under see through.) The next time Laura wore just the slip, sans bra and panties. The slip had a slit in it high enough to show that there was no panty underneath. (One of the ladies wore just a French bra, above the waist, with her nipples on full display.)
The other ladies wore the same kind of semi-whore outfits that Laura was wearing, apparently egged on by each other.. I could tell where it would end up, but I also saw Laura getting free from her childhood hangups about nudity. At work Laura had to be very conservative. At home Laura was a raging exhibitionist. We had a long talk about that.
Neither Laura or I had had any sexual experience before our marriage. At first, Laura's hangups had held us back. Now, Laura pointed out, it was our inexperience that was holding us back. I didn't really like the idea, but I could see that Laura was right. We did agree that we were together no matter what. I was worried I might lose Laura, however, I agreed that we would try a little experimenting.
One night, we went over to visit Alice and Albert, our next door neighbors. Albert had never been able to keep his eyes off Laura and Laura told me that Alice wanted to try me.
Laura wore her see through dress, garter belt, nylons, stiletto heels and a smile. Oh yes, just so that no one would miss anything, Laura had shaved her pubic hair and presented a smooth, slick pussy for everyone's viewing pleasure.",Smashwords Edition,8.0,2015.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26051031-nude-neighbors,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438883907m/26051031.jpg,Nude Neighbors,R.

In the long title story, ""Black Glass"", temperance activist Carry Nation is resurrected in the 1990s (""We're talking about a very troubled, very big woman,"" says one shaken barman to reporters) and becomes such a nuisance that the DEA is forced to dispatch her with voodoo. Other plots are only slightly less outrageous in conceit. In ""Lieserl,"" a lovesick madwoman dupes Albert Einstein into believing he has a daughter; in ""The Faithful Companion at Forty,"" Tonto admits to second thoughts about his biggest life choice (""But for every day, for your ordinary life, a mask is only going to make you more obvious. There's an element of exhibitionism in it"").
""The Travails"" offers a peek at the one-sided correspondence of Mary Gulliver, who wants Lemuel to come home already and help out around the house. The homage to Swift makes sense, for, when Fowler doesn't settle for amusing her readers, she makes a lively satirist.
The extraterrestrials who appear in her stories (whether the inscrutably sadistic monsters in ""Duplicity"" or the members of a seminar studying late-1960s college behavior in ""The View from Venus: A Case Study"") seem stand-ins for the author herself, who, in elegant and witty prose, cultivates the eye of a curious alien and, along the way, unfolds eccentric plots that keep the pages turning.

To those of you who enjoyed Anne Easter Smith's historical novel about Cecily, TWO MURDERS REAPED uncovers the last thirty-five years of Cecylee's life.
It is in October, 1459. Cecylee is forty-four years old and has been abandoned at Ludlow Castle by her husband, Richard Duke of York, who has fled to elude capture. Yet Cecylee calmly walks down to the marketplace in Rouen, and waits for the Lancastrian army.
What happens next is something that Cecylee could not have imagined in her worst nightmare.

But now, summoned by the eccentric Earl of Annerdale and his controversial scheme to reintroduce the Grey Wolf to the English countryside, she is back in the peat and wet light of the Lake District.
The earl's project harks back to an ancient idyll of untamed British wilderness - though Rachel must contend with modern-day concessions to health and safety, public outrage and political gain - and the return of the Grey after hundreds of years coincides with her own regeneration: impending motherhood, and reconciliation with her estranged family.

The birth of utopic thinking, it argues, is tied to an understanding of alterity having as much to do with the ways the medieval West understood itself as the manner in which the foreign was mapped. Drawing upon the insights of cultural studies, film studies, and psychoanalysis, this book rethinks the contours of the known and the unknown in the medieval period. It demonstrates how the idea of otherness intersected in intricate ways with other categories of difference (spatial, gender, and religious).

How Music Got Freeis a riveting story of obsession, music, crime, and money, featuring visionaries and criminals, moguls and tech-savvy teenagers. It's about the greatest pirate in history, the most powerful executive in the music business, a revolutionary invention and an illegal website four times the size of the iTunes Music Store.
Journalist Stephen Witt traces the secret history of digital music piracy, from the German audio engineers who invented the mp3, to a North Carolina compact-disc manufacturing plant where factory worker Dell Glover leaked nearly two thousand albums over the course of a decade, to the high-rises of midtown Manhattan where music executive Doug Morris cornered the global market on rap, and, finally, into the darkest recesses of the Internet.
Through these interwoven narratives, Witt has written a thrilling book that depicts the moment in history when ordinary life became forever entwined with the world online -- when, suddenly, all the music ever recorded was available for free. In the page-turning tradition of writers like Michael Lewis and Lawrence Wright, Witt's deeply-reported first book introduces the unforgettable characters--inventors, executives, factory workers, and smugglers--who revolutionized an entire artform, and reveals for the first time the secret underworld of media pirates that transformed our digital lives.
An irresistible never-before-told story of greed, cunning, genius, and deceit, How Music Got Freeisn't just a story of the music industry--it's a must-read history of the Internet itself.

As Diana Morrison laid the table for six at her elegant Central Park apartment, there was no warning of what was to come. Spending New Year's Eve together was a sacred tradition for Diana, her husband of thirty-two years, Eric, and their best friends, Pascale and John Donnally and Anne and Robert Smith. The future looked rosy as the long-time friends sipped champagne and talked of renting a villa together in the South of France the following summer. But life had other plans...
Just two weeks after New Year's, tragedy strikes the heart of their close circle, as Robert Smith suffers a sudden, unexpected loss. Without hesitation, Diana and Eric, Pascale and John rally to his side, united in their support, love, and shared grief. Convinced that a change of scenery is just what Robert needs, they urge him to join them on the Riviera in August. But as they soon discover, the ramshackle old mansion they rented in St. Tropez--sight unseen--is far different from the exquisite villa and sun-drenched gardens touted in the brochure. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling. Beds collapse beneath them. All while a would-be housekeeper in a leopard-skin bikini and six-inch heels sashays through the house with a trio of yapping poodles at her heels. But the biggest surprise of all is the woman Robert invites to the villa as his guest--a lovely, much-younger film actress with mile-long legs and a million-dollar smile. Diana and Pascale hate her on sight. But the men are dazzled. And amid the crumbling furniture and the glorious sunsets, the strained relationships and the acts of forgiveness, more surprises are in store for the villa's occupants.

In their first collaborative book, Ivan and Rae explore and expose their failed attempts at fitting into the gender binary, and how ultimately our expectations and assumptions around traditional gender roles fail us all.

After details of American government surveillance were published in 2013, Edward Snowden, formerly a subcontracted IT analyst for the NSA, became the center of an international controversy: Was he a hero, traitor, whistle-blower, spy? Was his theft legitimized by the nature of the information he exposed? When is it necessary for governmental transparency to give way to subterfuge?
Edward Jay Epstein brings a lifetime of journalistic and investigative acumen to bear on these and other questions, delving into both how our secrets were taken and the man who took them. He makes clear that by outsourcing parts of our security apparatus, the government has made classified information far more vulnerable; how Snowden sought employment precisely where he could most easily gain access to the most sensitive classified material; and how, though he claims to have acted to serve his country, Snowden is treated as a prized intelligence asset in Moscow, his new home.""",Knopf Publishing Group,355.0,2017.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30900207-how-america-lost-its-secrets,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1473540079m/30900207.jpg,"How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward Snowden, the Man and the Theft",Edward Jay Epstein,9780451494566,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Politics', 'Espionage', 'American', 'True Crime', 'Audiobook']"

A Death in California: When twice-divorced Beverly Hills socialite Hope Masters fell in love with a handsome advertising executive, she thought her life was finally turning around--until she woke up to find a gun in her mouth and her fiance dead in the next room. The killer was a new acquaintance who'd been visiting the couple's Sierra Nevada ranch. Even more bizarre, however, was what happened at the end of the long, nightmarish weekend in which Masters saw everything she cared about destroyed: She began to fall in love with her tormenter. ""Superbly documented, brilliantly written. The suspense will keep readers caught to the very last page"" (Ann Rule, bestselling author of The Stranger Beside Me).
A Death in Canaan: When eighteen-year-old Peter Reilly arrived home from the Teen Center one night to discover his mother lying naked on the bedroom floor with her throat slashed, local police made him their prime suspect. After eight hours of interrogation and a polygraph test, Reilly confessed. But the townspeople of Canaan, Connecticut, couldn't believe the naive teenager was capable of such a gruesome crime. With the help of some celebrities, including Mike Nichols and William Styron, the community rallied to the boy's defense. Barthel's ""riveting"" account of this fascinating and frightening case was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize (People).
Love or Honor: Police officer Chris Anastos was happily married and satisfied with his work on the NYPD's anti-crime unit--until he was asked to go undercover to investigate links between the Italian mob and a Greek criminal network in Queens. For five years he moved back and forth between his comfortable home life and a murky, underground world of wise guys, pimps, and thieves.

The planning & misexecution of the project has been covered until now mainly as a subtheme in memoirs & general books about the JFK years. Former Newsweek correspondent Wyden has gathered information from the Cuban exiles & from within Cuba itself--as well as from Washington sources--to uncover ""the untold story""; but essentials remain unchanged. His access to Cuban sources has been squandered on eyewitness accounts of the battle, so that we learn more about the minute-by-minute proceedings than anyone could want to know, but little about the impact of the invasion on Cuba or Cuban attitudes toward the USA. He's dealt with CIA reports that accurately gauged the level of Castro's popular support in Cuba, but were bypassed by CIA planners in favor of less accurate ones foreseeing potential success. These, however, are ignored while he gets into the old squabble over the operation's chances had Kennedy not canceled a 2nd air strike aimed at destroying the Cuban air force. His obsession with trivial details--like each person's garb at any given moment--overwhelms any analytic potential. Because Wm Fulbright was the only one in the know who strenuously opposed the operation, he concludes that ""groupthink"" & ""assumed consensus"" prevented all these brilliant people--by his reckoning, almost anyone with a Yale background & a position of power qualifies--from realizing that the plan was a mess. Therefore, ""it could happen again!"" Of course, if all those bureaucrats, lawyers & academics weren't so brilliant, the answer may lie elsewhere; not in why the Bay of Pigs wasn't stopped, but in why it was started. On that, he's not much help.--Kirkus (edited)

A real historical figure, Ines Suarez came to Chile with the Conquistadors in 1540, helping to claim the territory for Spain and to found the first Spanish settlement in Santiago.

Trevor Noah's unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents' indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa's tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.
Born a Crimeis the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother: his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.
The eighteen personal essays collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty.

This sliver of land located between the rivers was evolving from a bustling seaport into a world financial center. Manhattan rapidly became America's preeminent East Coast steamship port. Steamers were becoming a frequent and luxurious mode of transportation. They arrived in Manhattan carrying passengers from all walks of life--the very rich and the very poor. Wealthy travelers made their voyages on the palatial reaches of the upper decks and were the catalyst that spawned the gilded era of Manhattan's hotels. Working-class passengers, on the other hand, traveled deep below decks. From the damp, dark reaches of the steamers poured a flood of immigrant labor and talent that enriched the area's industries. In the 1880s, no building stood as tall as the spire of architect Richard Upjohn's Trinity Church. Along the city streetscape, trolleys were pulled by horses, and steam-powered, elevated trains sliced north from the battery to upper Manhattan.

They ring the bell, though no one is expecting them. They don't speak English. They've arrived from Russia with only $700 and the conviction that this six-year-old will be the next tennis star. Surprisingly, they are right.
Young Maria Sharapova went on to become one of the best, most famous, and highest-paid athletes. At seventeen, she won Wimbledon. At eighteen, she was ranked number one. To date, she has won five Grand Slams. Her stardom spills off the court to fashion, philanthropy, food.

The backlash was shocking--sponsors fled, fans berated her, and she received a two-year suspension. Despite successfully appealing her sentence, she still faced the battle of maintaining her eminence on the court and her place in fans' hearts. In this gripping autobiography, Sharapova traces her precarious beginnings in Siberia to her controversial doping ban.

On a dim winter afternoon, a young Irish immigrant opens the gas taps in his Brooklyn tenement. He is determined to prove--to the subway bosses who have recently fired him, to his badgering, pregnant wife--""that the hours of his life belong to himself alone."" In the aftermath of the fire that follows, Sister St. Savior, an aging nun, appears, unbidden, to direct the way forward for his widow and his unborn child.
We begin deep inside Catholic Brooklyn, in the early part of the twentieth century. Decorum, superstition, and shame collude to erase the man's brief existence. Yet his suicide, although never spoken of, reverberates through many lives and over the decades--testing the limits and the demands of love and sacrifice, of forgiveness and forgetfulness, even through multiple generations.

His first mission as captain, to transport a group of displaced colonists back to their home planet of Loran II, seems easy enough: make sure the planet is safe for colonization, unload the settlers, and head back to Earth. He even has an extra reason to enjoy the trip -- his sister, Sekaya, has joined the mission as a spiritual advisor to the gentle, peace-loving colonists.

A Quiet Flame opens in 1950. Falsely fingered a war criminal, Bernie Gunther has booked passage to Buenos Aires, lured, like the Nazis whose company he has always despised, by promises of a new life and a clean passport from the Per?n government. But Bernie doesn't have the luxury of settling into his new home and lying low. He is soon pressured by the local police into taking on a case in which a girl has turned up dead, gruesomely mutilated, and another--the daughter of a wealthy German banker--has gone missing. Both crimes seem to connect to an unsolved case Bernie worked on back in Berlin in 1932. It's not so far-fetched that the cases might be linked: after all, the scum of the earth has been washing up on Argentine shores--state-licensed murderers and torturers--so why couldn't a serial killer be among them?
But Argentina, just like Germany, holds terrible secrets within its corrupt halls of power. When beautiful Anna Yagubsky seeks Gunther out, desperate for help, to find out what happened to her Jewish aunt and uncle who have disappeared, he is drawn into a horror story that rivals everything he has tried so hard to leave behind half a world away.
In this new postwar world, Bernie Gunther is a man without a name or a country, but still in full possession of his conscience.

""Great writers can be inhibiting, and maybe after one has read a Scott Fitzgerald or Henry James one can't escape imitating them; but more often such writers are inspiring.""--Richard Cohen
Behind every acclaimed work of literature is a trove of heartfelt decisions. The best authors put painstaking--sometimes obsessive--effort into each element of their stories, from plot and character development to dialogue and point of view.
What made Nabokov choose the name Lolita? Why did Fitzgerald use first-person narration in The Great Gatsby? How did Kerouac, who raged against revision, finally come to revise On the Road? Veteran editor and teacher Richard Cohen draws on his vast reservoir of a lifetime's reading and his insight into what makes good prose soar. Here are Gabriel Garcia Marquez's thoughts on how to start a novel (""In the first paragraph you solve most of the problems with your book""); Virginia Woolf offering her definition of style (""It is all rhythm. Once you get that, you can't use the wrong words""); and Vladimir Nabokov on the nature of fiction (""All great novels are great fairy tales"").
Cohen has researched the published works and private utterances of our greatest authors to discover the elements that made their prose memorable. The result is a unique exploration of the act and art of writing that enriches our experience of reading both the classics and the best modern fiction. Evoking the marvelous, the famous, and the irreverent, he reveals the challenges that even the greatest writers faced--and shows us how they surmounted them.

Kidnapped and held for ransom at nineteen, ducal heir William Ravenwood knows the only person he can rely on is himself. Now part of a spy ring that includes his friends Nicolas and Richard Hampden, he's the smuggler known as The Raven, a ruthless agent who specializes in rescuing hostages and prisoners of war from captivity.
Raven longs to discover the fate of his colleague, Christopher 'Kit' Carlisle, who's been missing, presumed dead, for over two years. He's also equally determined to stay away from the one thing he knows is dangerous to his health - the bane of his life, his best friends' infuriating and provocative little sister, Heloise.
Heloise is a brilliant code breaker, one of the English government's most valuable assets. She's also loved Raven for years, but considering that he rejected her at sixteen, before her face was scarred rescuing her brother from an icy river, she's certain he doesn't want her now, despite his outrageous flirting.
But when Heloise decodes a message that proves Kit is alive and a prisoner in Spain, Raven realizes she's in grave danger. With French agents determined to silence her, he'll do whatever it takes to keep her safe - even if that means taking her to Spain with him as an unwilling hostage.
As they face French deserters and Spanish freedom fighters, Raven and Heloise try to ignore the simmering attraction that's been building between them for eight long years. The differences between them are striking but they've always had a strange underlying bond. Heloise might be scarred outwardly, but Raven's wounds are all on the inside.

Murphy follows each would-be assassin and the repercussions of their actions, illuminating daily life in Victorian England, the development of the monarchy under Queen Victoria and the evolution of the attacks in light of evolving social issues and technology.
There was Edward Oxford, a bartender who dreamed of becoming an admiral, who was simply shocked when his attempt to shoot the pregnant Queen and Prince consort made him a madman in the world's eyes. There was hunchbacked John Bean, who dreamed of historical notoriety in a publicized treason trial, and William Hamilton, forever scarred by the ravages of the Irish Potato Famine. Roderick MacLean enabled Victoria to successfully strike insanity pleas from Britain's legal process. Most threatening of all were the ""dynamitards"" who targeted her Majesty's Golden Jubilee--who signaled the advent of modern terrorism with their publicly focused attack.
From these cloak-and-dagger plots to Victoria's brilliant wit and steadfast courage, Shooting Victoriais historical narrative at its most thrilling, complete with astute insight into how these attacks actually revitalized the British crown at a time when monarchy was quickly becoming unpopular abroad. While thrones across Europe toppled, the Queen's would-be assassins contributed greatly to the preservation of the monarchy and to the stability that it enjoys today.

767,1731,eng,3.93,"For decades after 1945, it was generally believed that the German army, professional and morally decent, had largely stood apart from the SS, Gestapo, and other corps of the Nazi machine. Ben Shepherd draws on a wealth of primary sources and recent scholarship to convey a much darker, more complex picture. For the first time, the German army is examined throughout the Second World War, across all combat theaters and occupied regions, and from multiple perspectives: its battle performance, social composition, relationship with the Nazi state, and involvement in war crimes and military occupation.
This was a true people's army, drawn from across German society and reflecting that society as it existed under the Nazis. Without the army and its conquests abroad, Shepherd explains, the Nazi regime could not have perpetrated its crimes against Jews, prisoners of war, and civilians in occupied countries. The author examines how the army was complicit in these crimes and why some soldiers, units, and higher commands were more complicit than others. Shepherd also reveals the reasons for the army's early battlefield successes and its mounting defeats up to 1945, the latter due not only to Allied superiority and Hitler's mismanagement as commander-in-chief, but also to the failings--moral, political, economic, strategic, and operational--of the army's own leadership.",Yale University Press,664.0,2016.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27157558-hitler-s-soldiers,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1444692577m/27157558.jpg,Hitler's Soldiers: The German Army in the Third Reich,Ben H.

In this first book in the Knowing What Counts series, authors Kathleen Gregory, Caren Cameron, and Anne Davies provide tools for teachers to help students envision and develop that picture. The first section of this book outlines a four-step process for working with students to set criteria that encourage participation, understanding, and ownership. The authors provide specific examples of what each step in this process might look like. Five scenarios of setting criteria with students are then provided and can be adapted to meet an array of specific needs and situations. The second part of this book offers ten ways to assess student work and provide specific and descriptive feedback to help students improve their learning and academic performance without assigning a mark or using a traditional grading system. The third section provides a list of common questions educators may have as they attempt to implement the strategies described in the first two sections.

772,1739,eng,4.06,"When a novel like Huckleberry Finn, or The Yearling, comes along it defies customary adjectives because of the intensity of the respouse it evokes in the reader. Such a book, we submit, is Old Yeller; to read this eloquently simple story of a boy and his dog in the Texas hill country is an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.
The big, ugly, yellow dog showed up out of nowhere one night and stole a whole side of hanging pork, and when Travis went for him the next morning that dog started yelling like a baby before he was touched. Then he got into the spring water with five-year-old Arliss, Travis took an easy hate to Old Yeller, as they started to call him; in fact, he would have driven him off or killed him if it hadn't been for brother Arliss' loud and violent protests, So Yeller stayed, and Travis soon found he couldn't have got along without him.
Pa and Ma and Travis and Arliss lived on Birdsong Creek in the Texas hill country. It wasn't an easy life, but they had a snug cabin that Pa had built himself, and they had their own hogs and their own cattle, and they grew most of what else they needed. The only thing they and the rest of the settlers lacked that year in the late 1860's was cash, so the men decided to get together and drive all the cattle up to the new market in Abilene, Kansas, more than six hundred miles away.
Travis was only fourteen, but he was proud of his new role as man of the family and determined to live up to his responsibility. It was hard work, too, plowing until his legs ached, chopping wood until his hands were raw and his head was spinning, weeding the garden in the hot sun, toting the heavy buckets tip from the spring, and trying to keep his mischievous little brother in line.
But there were pleasant moments, too: his Ma treating him like a man, and deer hunting in the early-morning stillness, and hot summer nights out in the corn patch under the stars with Old Yeller, trying to keep the coons and skunks out of the winter food supply. And there was plenty of excitement, like the fight between the two bulls, and the time Arliss nearly got mauled by the bear, and trying to catch and mark the new hogs. Here the suspense and excitement reach a peak, only to be topped a few pages later when the crazy-sick loafer wolf goes for Ma. Both times it is Yeller who saves them, only the second time it is not lucky for Yeller, as Travis comes to find out. And in finding out, Travis learns just how much he has come to love that big ugly dog, and he learns something about the pain of life, too.
Old Yeller is a story that will be read and treasured by many thousands for years to come.

April of 1958--the Iron Curtain was at its heaviest, and the outcome of the Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition seemed preordained.

It is a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most remarkable events in musical history, filled with political intrigue and personal struggle as artists strove for self-expression and governments jockeyed for prestige.

Seeley, a former gaming industry CEO and professional blackjack player, first introduced readers to good-guy-with-a-past protagonist Jack Sloan in the 2010 award-winning mystery/suspense novel, Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves. Now, Sloan returns in this crisply paced follow-up, the second book of an expected trilogy.
17 Degrees North follows a trail between Juarez and Santa Fe, with stops along the way in El Paso and Phoenix. The story begins and ends in the barrancos of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains north of Santa Fe, with Jack's fateful discovery of a mysterious satchel full of cash. Jack tells his wife Darlene about his find, and they're quickly drawn into the most dangerous mystery of their lives.
Readers soon discover that the money is tied to the kidnapping/murder of a prominent New York hedge fund manager taken hostage in Juarez then killed in New Mexico. The U.S. and Mexican authorities working together to solve the case know something doesn't fit, but they'll need Jack to find out what. Pendleton's beautiful wife is also connected, but how remains as much of a mystery as what a man like Pendleton was doing in a place like Juarez in the first place.

by Richard Laymon
Featuring a special introduction by Kelly Laymon explaining the history of the manuscript, how this version came to exist, and why this edition is more than just 50 pages of deleted scenes added back in, but instead a totally different novel you've never read before!
About the Book:
Neala and her friend Sherri only wanted to do a little backpacking through the woods. Little did they know they would soon be shackled to a dead tree, waiting for Them to arrive. The Dills family thought the small motor lodge in the quiet town of Barlow seemed quaint and harmless enough. Until they, too, found themselves shackled to trees in the middle of the night, while They approached, hungry for human flesh....
When this classic novel was first published in 1981, it was heavily cut, with nearly fifty pages removed. What remained was rewritten by both Laymon and a Warner Books line editor. Now, for the first time ever, the missing text has been completely restored--along with Laymon's original words and vision -- and the novel can finally be read the way it was intended.
An excerpt from Kelly Laymon's special introduction to this edition:
""The version you're about to read was the one that was first submitted to Warner Books... Those of you who have read the Warner edition will notice that the two books are very different after, say, Chapter 8 or so. How did I do it? Especially since my father said it couldn't be done? I'm not sure. It was all there. But the pieces weren't in the same place. There were boxes of thirty year old manuscripts and I had played with the various drafts many times over the last six or seven years. I always believed it could be done. I sure had false starts though. I had to get to know each draft of the manuscript. Not by the content of the pages, but by the pages themselves. I evaluated them based on page numbering styles and other forms of continuity. I didn't want to read any draft until I had settled on what I believed was the true manuscript....""",Cemetery Dance Publications,240.0,2008.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3436282-the-woods-are-dark,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1337319998m/3436282.jpg,The Woods Are Dark,Richard Laymon,9781587671975,"['Horror', 'Splatterpunk', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Suspense', 'Mystery']"

For a select group of girls, the Glittering Court offers a shot at a life they've only ever dreamed of, one of luxury, glamour, and leisure. To high-born Adelaide, whose wealthy family is forcing her into a loveless marriage, the Glittering Court represents something else: the chance to chart her own destiny, and adventure in an unspoiled, prosperous new land across the sea.
After a chance meeting with the dazzling Cedric Thorn, Adelaide poses as a servant to join the crop of impoverished girls he promises to transform into proper ladies. But her familiarity with upper class life comes with a price: she must hide her identity from her new friends, mysterious refugee Mira and fiery former laundress Tamsin, and most importantly, from Cedric himself--even though she's falling in love with him.
Everything begins to crumble when Cedric discovers Adelaide's ruse, and she catches the eye of a powerful young governor, who wants her for a wife. She didn't leave the gilded cage of her old life behind just to become someone else's property.

When the village postmistress is found dead with a poison-pen letter at her feet, the coroner confirms Hamish's worst fears, that the woman's apparent suicide was in fact a carefully concealed murder. Now it's up to Hamish to trace the letters and the escalating violence to the source.
His efforts are both aided and complicated by the arrival of Jenny Ogilvie, a lovely lady whose passion for Hamish is only equaled by her dangerous curiosity about the murderous poison pen who is her rival for Hamish's attention.

The tragic story of Jill Meagher found its way deeply into the psyche of ordinary citizens. In the chilly early hours of 22nd September 2012, 29 year-old Irishborn Jill Meagher was dragged into a darkened laneway in the centre of a bustling inner-city Melbourne alley only five hundred metres from her front doorstep. In that lonely and dingy Brunswick alley, Jill Meagher was viciously overpowered, raped and murdered by Adrian Ernest Bayley. Later that morning her stalking killer returned to retrieve Jill's defiled body, which he heartlessly dumped in a shallow grave fifty kilometres from the city before deviously beginning to cover his grubby tracks. One of the most recognised crimes that outraged Australia.

He looks at the central place of prayer in the Rule of St Benedict and the tradition of continuous prayer, exploring the teaching of such formative figures as Basil the Great. He then reflects on the Benedictine precept: 'nothing is to be preferred to the work of God'.
Praying with Benedictlooks in practical terms at the how, when, and where of prayer; at bodily postures, various types of prayer, and the importance of emotional and spiritual readiness. Finally, the place of the Eucharist in the life of prayer is discussed with reference to Benedict's teaching and the Eucharistic practices of pre-Benedictine monasticism.

Asher Peterson is a self-made man, owner of the Electric Tunnel, Sin City's hottest adult entertainment spot. Brazen and formidable in designer T-shirts and motorcycle boots, he seems unflappable whether he's making his rounds through the decadent decor of the Tunnel, or whipping through the desert heat on his bike. But inside he is a shattered man, desperate to understand what unconditional love from a woman feels like.
Hiding the effects of his emotionally stunted youth behind a gritty persona, and keeping his fractured soul buried deep while seeking out his baser instincts, Asher is convinced he is man enough to leave the past in the past. The only clue to his broken soul is his deep-seated need to provide safety and a good life for emotionally damaged women within the glamorous walls of his strip club.
Fooling himself that he deserves little in life, Asher keeps his big heart tightly guarded with everyone but Sienna Flower, his friend, business partner, and headliner. Until, that is, the night he runs into his childhood friend, Natalie Parker. While trolling a rival strip club, perusing their offerings for his own personal pleasure, he collides with his past. Coming face-to-face with a woman he only knew as a girl, he's shaken when he finds the dark-haired beauty in a precarious position. Now all grown up, she's a hardened soul who reminds him of where he came from, and stirs within him the need to protect yet another woman.
Known as Nat to most everyone, Natalie is a single mom to Quinn. But when she's under the bright spotlights in a thong, she's known as Natasha or Nataleigh Dallas. A girl who once had everything going for her, she's now a jaded stripper with only room for her son in her life, and has erected impenetrable barriers around her heart. The strength of those walls is challenged the night a man she has known since childhood steamrolls his way back into her life, flashing those smoky-gray eyes that have always melted her.
A man she has loved from afar since she was a young girl, one who lights fire to her walls, burning deeper, setting everything ablaze--smoldering her.
Asher and Natalie, two people who are equally tormented by their own demons, set out to rescue each other as part-time lovers in a torrid, desperate workplace affair. Thinking they can remain friends while keeping their hearts at a safe distance, they find themselves at odds when their situation morphs into a messy, tangled mess.

The great raven, Wark has died, and the citizens elect Brighton Aviamore the new Chancellor. The Falcon Rider's first challenge is to stop the mysterious winds that are growing worse by the day. But when Willowmena is kidnapped by a monstrous bird, and Brighton discovers she's been taken to a land called Amaraka, he abandons all other concerns, and swears an oath to get her back. Forced to traverse the dimensions of time and space, and reincarnate in a new body, Brighton is reborn in Kansas shortly after the end of the American Civil War which has been won by the South. An elitist mob of Rutheneist tycoons (part zombie, part vampire) are destroying the earth out of greed, and the same winds ripping apart Perpetua are driving humanity underground. Brighton grows up to be a brilliant inventor and aviator. He attends the finest steam technology university in the country where students race single-man steam jets in a city filled with a bewildering array of Babbage-steam driven vehicles, airships, and other inventions. Joined by Will, Pello, and Biffee (also incarnated as humans), Brighton discovers the winds are originating from an oceanic whirlpool that's being fueled by manmade disruptions to the environment. Though determined to find a solution, he faces a series of devastating traumas including Will's murder. Assisted by a small army of robots, he constructs an enormous levitating platform in the shape of a falcon to carry a reverse-ionization device over the sea and restore balance to the discordant atmosphere. His nemesis, Dredgemont has also incarnated in America, and sets out to destroy him by raising an army of phantom gorpes, trolls, and bats, including Gretch and Malgor. A clash of spirit armies takes place amidst the global hurricane and the Skookumchuck whirlpool threatens to swallow Brighton and his fantastic airship to the bottom of the sea.

Nicknamed ""the Blonde Borgia,"" Anna Marie Hahn was a cold-blooded serial killer who preyed on the elderly in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine district in the 1930s. When the State of Ohio strapped its first woman into the electric chair, Hahn gained a place in the annals of crime as the nation's first female serial killer to be executed in the chair.
Told here for the first time in riveting detail is Anna Marie's gripping story, an almost unbelievable tale of multiple murders, deceit, and greed.
Born in Bavaria in 1906, Anna Marie brought shame to her pious family when, as a teenager, she gave birth to an illegitimate son, Oscar. She was shipped off to America in 1929 where she initially lived with elderly relatives in Cincinnati. A year later she married Philip Hahn, a Western Union telegrapher, with whom she bought a new house and opened a delicatessen/bakery.

Charlie Bundrum was a roofer, a carpenter, a whiskey-maker, a fisherman who knew every inch of the Coosa River, made boats out of car hoods and knew how to pack a wound with brown sugar to stop the blood. He could not read, but he asked his wife, Ava, to read him the paper every day so he would not be ignorant.

In the decade of the Great Depression, Charlie moved his family twenty-one times, keeping seven children one step ahead of the poverty and starvation that threatened them from every side. He worked at the steel mill when the steel was rolling, or for a side of bacon or a bushel of peaches when it wasn't. He paid the doctor who delivered his fourth daughter, Margaret -- Bragg's mother -- with a jar of whiskey. He understood the finer points of the law as it applied to poor people and drinking men; he was a banjo player and a buck dancer who worked off fines when life got a little sideways, and he sang when he was drunk, where other men fought or cussed.

SAVAK's systematic torture of Evin Prison's inmates infuriates and confronts Jamsheed's conscience and security status to the point of underground resistance. Subsequently, he is publicly branded a fugitive of the law, which compels him to forge a fragile, unlikely alliance with outlawed, anti-regime resistance fighters and political organizations, including the communist-leaning Tudeh Party. His one-year asylum under the protection of Tehran's Assyrian Church subjects him to a brief romantic encounter with loyal church member Fareeda, an outspoken, nurse and daring Assyrian freedom fighter. He is also conflicted by his own covert actions, constantly questioning whether they are driven by his instinctive desire to seek justice or revenge, particularly when obsessed by an unrelenting crave to embarrass his former commander Nabizadeh before the shah, he blindly admires, and expose him embroiled in multiple scandals, including blackmail, drug trafficking and child kidnapping. As Jamsheed's world increasingly slips on the fast track of regime change, he and brother Mahmood reluctantly flee Iran before travel restrictions are imposed, as their homeland is poised to welcome its exiled religious leader, the Ayatollah Raola Khomeini, in February of 1979.

Now we return to that famous courthouse in Clanton as Jake Brigance once again finds himself embroiled in a fiercely controversial trial-a trial that will expose old racial tensions and force Ford County to confront its tortured history.
Seth Hubbard is a wealthy man dying of lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree, Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten, will. It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County's most notorious citizens, just three years earlier.
The second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?
In Sycamore Row, John Grisham returns to the setting and the compelling characters that first established him as America's favorite storyteller.

From the title story, about an impoverished, henpecked scholar who is transformed by the love of a voluptuous bird, to ""The Chrysanthemum Spirit,"" about a passionate gardener who meets a brother and sister with extraordinary powers, Dazai creates a world of fantasy and romance that is infused with his own psychological concerns. Many readers may recall the poignancy of Oscar Wilde's The Happy Princeor Han Christian Andersen.
The collection is capped by two delightful stories-within-a-story, in which the assorted members of a quirky family compose alternate episodes of a slightly gothic romance with hints of Poe and Saki (in ""On Love and Beauty"") and a wildly elaborate retelling of Rapunzel that is engaging, horrifying, and touching by turns (in ""Lanterns of Romance"").

Dani, unlike her predecessor, Daisy Mae, has no qualifications or background knowledge for the job. Instead she procures her answers from the Internet, self-help books and Megan, a retired prostitute who's had sex with thousands of guys.
About to turn 50, Dani yearns for more than one toothbrush in the bathroom, more than one car in the garage and definitely more than a greyhound with flatulence sharing her bed at night. The solution, she decides, is to start dating.
Meanwhile, one of Dani's readers (known only as Distinctly Frustrated) has written in asking her for advice. He complains his wife is not concentrating during sex, so Dani suggests foreplay using chocolate sauce and dress-ups. However, much to Dani's horror, a saboteur changes her reply to 'Shove something hot down the bitch's throat.'
The following morning, Distinctly Frustrated discovers his wife dead. Someone has indeed followed Dani's advice and 'shoved something hot' down the wife's throat. A red hot poker.
After first suspecting Dani due to evidence in her handbag and her sabotaged column suggestion, the police take the husband in for questioning.
Could the killer actually be Jack Rivers, sleazy bad boy from Gape, a rival newspaper? Did he really pretend to be Dani's blind date just to get her in an uncompromising position so he could publish photos of her rolls of fat and cellulite in his trashy magazine - or was it all to do with slipping incriminating evidence into her handbag while she was otherwise engaged?
Or what about Alice? The Tribute's spaced-out receptionist-cum-tea-lady, who was Daisy Mae's stepsister. When Daisy Mae died, Alice thought she'd get the job of writing the Sex On... column. Jealous of Dani's success, she adds salt to her tea, spills hot coffee on her lap and sticks pins in a Dani Summers lookalike voodoo doll. But would Alice take such a giant step forward and kill DF's wife to frame Dani for murder?
While chasing a killer, Dani discovers Mr. Right is slap bang under her nose. He's the guy who's been looking out for her all along. The guy who's there for her when her blind dates turn dangerous. The guy who shoves her out from under a lethal four-wheel drive intent on leaving its tire prints straight down the middle of her body.
Can Dani survive investigating the murder long enough to find true love?

Kennedy's tragic assassination.
In those four years, Hill was by Mrs. Kennedy's side for some of the happiest moments as well as the darkest. He was there for the birth of John, Jr. on November 25, 1960, as well as for the birth and sudden death of Patrick Bouvier Kennedy on August 8, 1963. Three and a half months later, the unthinkable happened.
Forty-seven years after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the one vivid image that never leaves Clint Hill's mind is that of President Kennedy's head lying on Mrs. Kennedy's lap in the back seat of the limousine, his eyes fixed, blood splattered all over the back of the car, Mrs. Kennedy, and Hill as well. Sprawled on the trunk of the car as it sped away from Dealey Plaza, Hill clung to the sides of the car, his feet wedged in so his body was as high as possible.
Clint Hill jumped on the car too late to save the president, but all he knew after that first shot was that if more shots were coming, the bullets had to hit him instead of the First Lady.

Aron, the narrator, is an engaging if peculiar and unhappy young boy whose family is driven by the German onslaught from the Polish countryside into Warsaw and slowly battered by deprivation, disease, and persecution. He and a handful of boys and girls risk their lives by scuttling around the ghetto to smuggle and trade contraband through the quarantine walls in hopes of keeping their fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters alive, hunted all the while by blackmailers and by Jewish, Polish, and German police, not to mention the Gestapo.
When his family is finally stripped away from him, Aron is rescued by Janusz Korczak, a doctor renowned throughout prewar Europe as an advocate of children's rights who, once the Nazis swept in, was put in charge of the Warsaw orphanage.

The novel follows Alice down a rabbit-hole and into a surreal world of strange and wonderful characters who constantly turn everything upside-down with their mind-boggling logic and word play, and their fantastic parodies. Carroll's fable illustrates his masterful ability to weave logic with nonsense in a tale that continues to delight all ages.While this great classic is widely available, the Broadview edition is unique. Richard Kelly combines Alice's Adventures in Wonderland not with the later (and largely distinct) work Through the Looking Glass but rather with Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Lewis Carroll's first version of the story. Readers are thus able to trace the literary revisions, and to compare Caroll's own illustrations in the original with the famous John Tenniel illustrations for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

They all borrowed heavily to attend a third-tier, for-profit law school so mediocre that its graduates rarely pass the bar exam, let alone get good jobs. And when they learn that their school is one of a chain owned by a shady New York hedge-fund operator who also happens to own a bank specializing in student loans, the three know they have been caught up in The Great Law School Scam.
But maybe there's a way out. Maybe there's a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they would first have to quit school.

--Joseph Lease
Jenny Drai's work asks that the reader ""throw water against your heart as if that dragnet of emotions were a cliff. then master it."" Reading these poems is the experience of puzzling with, even throwing oneself against, glass. Each shard is ripe with danger, and yet a whole picture will emerge, deftly and with booming imagination, if you choose to engage with the elements of this language. What I love most about Jenny Drai's work is her faster-than-light, almost synesthetic switches. Poems that seem to be telling a love story are in fact heralding in a new color of visible light. And, of course, this teaches us what love really is.

Jenny Drai's The New Sorrow Is Less Than the Old Sorrow is one of those vibrating works that somehow find electrical current to the light bulbs in your memory that have long lost their incandescence. The warmth from those burning pears can warm the dark forgotten corners of your past, but they can also bathe old haunts with cold remembrances. They can even startle you and make you laugh out loud at your own surprise.

America's response to the September 11 attacks spotlighted many of the country's longstanding goals on the world stage: to protect liberty at home, to secure America's economic interests, to spread democracy in totalitarian regimes and to vanquish the enemy utterly.
One of America's leading foreign policy thinkers, Walter Russell Mead, argues that these diverse, conflicting impulses have in fact been the key to the U.S.'s success in the world. In a sweeping new synthesis, Mead uncovers four distinct historical patterns in foreign policy, each exemplified by a towering figure from our past.
Wilsonians are moral missionaries, making the world safe for democracy by creating international watchdogs like the U.N. Hamiltonians likewise support international engagement, but their goal is to open foreign markets and expand the economy. Populist Jacksonians support a strong military, one that should be used rarely, but then with overwhelming force to bring the enemy to its knees. Jeffersonians, concerned primarily with liberty at home, are suspicious of both big military and large-scale international projects.

Over the course of minutes, they would kill twelve students and a teacher and wound twenty-four others before taking their own lives.For the last sixteen years, Sue Klebold, Dylan's mother, has lived with the indescribable grief and shame of that day. How could her child, the promising young man she had loved and raised, be responsible for such horror? And how, as his mother, had she not known something was wrong?

""This brilliant and magisterial book is a very good bet to...become the definitive study of Johannes Brahms.""--The Plain Dealer
Judicious, compassionate, and full of insight into Brahms's human complexity as well as his music, Johannes Brahms is an indispensable biography.
Proclaimed the new messiah of Romanticism by Robert Schumann when he was only twenty, Johannes Brahms dedicated himself to a long and extraordinarily productive career. In this book, Jan Swafford sets out to reveal the little-known Brahms, the boy who grew up in mercantile Hamburg and played piano in beer halls among prostitutes and drunken sailors, the fiercely self-protective man who thwarted future biographers by burning papers, scores and notebooks late in his life. Making unprecedented use of the remaining archival material, Swafford offers richly expanded perspectives on Brahms's youth, on his difficult romantic life--particularly his longstanding relationship with Clara Schumann--and on his professional rivalry with Lizst and Wagner.

1005,2263,eng,3.19,"The Narn have been greatly wronged by the Centauri. During the domination of their world by that sophisticated and ruthless people, the Narn were slaves in all but name; forced to watch as their world was stripped of everything of value. And when at last they succeeded in driving the hated dictators from Narn space, they were left with little but their freedom.
They hate the Centauri, but have learned from them. The Narn sought out other worlds, rich with resources to supply their beggared home-world. They found them. And when those worlds had native populations, the Narn conquered them, enslaved them, and exploited them as ruthlessly as ever the Centauri at their worst might have. Now, the Centauri have struck again at the Narn and the two powers are embroiled in battle. It is a time when an enslaved people might see an opportunity to strike at their enemy; perhaps win their freedom. But in every conflict there comes a lull, a time when exhaustion temporarily causes even the bitterest opponents to call a truce, to rest and recoup, a time when allies try to make peace between the combatants, a time when reluctant rebels might hope for a peaceful solution before they drench their own hands in blood.
Babylon 5 will host a conference between the Narn and the Centauri. Nobody really expects peace and everyone is determined to remain uninvolved in the conflict, but everyone feels forced to go through the motions.",Dell,279.0,1996.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1222343.Betrayals,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328400392m/1222343.jpg,Betrayals,S.M.

1008,2266,eng,4.04,"Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells--taken without her knowledge--became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first ""immortal"" human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb's effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.
Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.
Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta's small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia--a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo--to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.
Henrietta's family did not learn of her ""immortality"" until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family--past and present--is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.
Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family--especially Henrietta's daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother's cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn't her children afford health insurance?

Now, Delaware's new adventure leads the sleuthing psychologist on a harrowing exploration into the realm he knows best: the human psyche, in all its complexity, mystery, and terrifying propensity for darkness.
""Been a while since I had me a nice little whodunit,""homicide detective Milo Sturgis tells Alex Delaware. But there's definitely nothing nice about the brutal tableau behind the yellow crime-scene tape. On a lonely lover's lane in the hills of Los Angeles, a young couple lies murdered in a car. Each bears a single gunshot wound to the head. The female victim has also been impaled by a metal spike. And that savage stroke of psychopathic fury tells Milo this case will call for more than standard police procedure. As he explains to Delaware, ""Now we're veering into your territory.""
It is dark territory, indeed. The dead woman remains unidentified and seemingly unknown to everyone. But her companion has a name: Gavin Quick--and his troubled past eventually landed him on a therapist's couch. It's there, on familiar turf, that Delaware hopes to find vital clues. And that means going head-to-head with Dr. Mary Lou Koppel, a popular celebrity psychologist who fiercely guards the privacy of her clients . . . dead or alive.
But when there's another gruesomely familiar murder, Delaware surmises that his investigation has struck a nerve. As he trolls the twisted wreckage of Quick's tormented last days, what he finds isn't madness, but the cold-blooded method behind it. And as he follows a chain of greed, corruption, and betrayal snaking hideously through the profession he thought he knew, he'll discover territory where even he never dreamed of treading.

""No one has ever written so beautifully and at the same time so without pity about the suffering in the isolated provincial villages of Hungary...His sentences have a surgical precision, and their sustained rhythm only reinforces the power of what they evoke.""--Nicole Henneberg, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
In a tiny village in northeast Hungary, close to the Romanian border, a young, unnamed boy warily observes day-to-day life and chronicles his family's struggles to survive. Like most of the villagers, his family is desperately poor, but their situation is worse than most--they are ostracized because of his father's Jewish heritage and his mother's connections to the Kulaks, who once owned land and supported the fascist Horthy regime before it was toppled by Communists.
With unflinching candor, the little boy's observations are related through a variety of narrative voices--crude diatribes from his alcoholic father, evocative and lyrical tales of the past from his grandparents, and his own simple yet potent prose. Together, these accounts reveal not only the history of his family but that of Hungary itself, through the physical and psychic traumas of two World Wars to the country's treatment of Jews, both past and present.

1023,2298,eng,3.33,"Robots are entering the mainstream. Technologies have advanced to the point of mass commercialization--Roomba, for example--and adoption by governments--most notably, their use of drones. Meanwhile, these devices are being received by a public whose main sources of information about robots are the fantasies of popular culture. We know a lot about C-3PO and Robocop but not much about Atlas, Motoman, Kiva, or Beam--real-life robots that are reinventing warfare, the industrial workplace, and collaboration. In this book, technology analyst John Jordan offers an accessible and engaging introduction to robots and robotics, covering state-of-the-art applications, economic implications, and cultural context.
Jordan chronicles the prehistory of robots and the treatment of robots in science fiction, movies, and television--from the outsized influence of Mary Shelley's Frankensteinto Isaac Asimov's I, Robot(in which Asimov coined the term ""robotics""). He offers a guided tour of robotics today, describing the components of robots, the complicating factors that make robotics so challenging, and such applications as driverless cars, unmanned warfare, and robots on the assembly line.
Roboticists draw on such technical fields as power management, materials science, and artificial intelligence. Jordan points out, however, that robotics design decisions also embody such nontechnical elements as value judgments, professional aspirations, and ethical assumptions, and raise questions that involve law, belief, economics, education, public safety, and human identity. Robots will be neither our slaves nor our overlords; instead, they are rapidly becoming our close companions, working in partnership with us--whether in a factory, on a highway, or as a prosthetic device. Given these profound changes to human work and life, Jordan argues that robotics is too important to be left solely to roboticists.",MIT Press,272.0,2016.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29889540-robots,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1462910351m/29889540.jpg,Robots,John M.

But he's the prime suspect after someone steals a fifty million dollar executive jet, and FBI agent Veronica Montero put him squarely in the crosshairs. As she digs, she discovers Nash's secret -- a revelation that, if made public, would stun the world. Operating on her own agenda, Montero blackmails Nash into helping her hunt down a man she wants dead.
Powerless against the information Montero holds, Nash is forced into a situation far deadlier than either of them could ever have imagined. The man they are after isn't the criminal they expect, he's a terrorist with a plan to use the stolen jet to carry out an unthinkable and devastating act that could plunge America into the most heinous conflict since World War II.
When Nash and Montero are taken prisoner aboard the stolen jet, they will have only one opportunity to execute a daring midair attempt to stop the attack.

Do you believe everything you read in the newspaper?
Early in August 1937, a news flash came: a sea monster had been spotted lurking off the shore of Nantucket Island. Historically, the Massachusetts island had served as port for whaling ships. Eyewitnesses swore this wasn't a whale, but some new, fearsome creature. As eyewitness account piled up, newspaper stories of the sea monster spread quickly. Across the nation, people shivered in fear.
Then, footprints were found on a Nantucket beach. Photographs were sent to prominent biologists for their opinion. Discussion swirled about raising a hunting party.
On August 18, news spread across the island: the sea monster had been captured. Islanders ran to the beach and couldn't believe their eyes.

She opens her eyes. The room is dark. She hears yelling, smashed plates, and wishes it was all a terrible dream. But it isn't. This is what it was like growing up as a Hemingway. In this deeply moving, searingly honest new memoir, actress and mental health icon Mariel Hemingway shares in candid detail the story of her troubled childhood in a famous family haunted by depression, alcoholism, illness, and suicide. Born just a few months after her grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, shot himself, it was Mariel's mission as a girl to escape the desperate cycles of severe mental health issues that had plagued generations of her family.
Surrounded by a family tortured by alcoholism (both parents), depression (her sister Margaux), suicide (her grandfather and four other members of her family), schizophrenia (her sister Muffet), and cancer (mother), it was all the young Mariel could do to keep her head. In a compassionate voice she reveals her painful struggle to stay sane as the youngest child in her family, and how she coped with the chaos by becoming OCD and obsessive about her food, schedule, and organization.
The twisted legacy of her family has never quite let go of Mariel, but now in this memoir she opens up about her claustrophobic marriage, her acting career, and turning to spiritual healers and charlatans for solace. Ultimately Mariel has written a story of triumph about learning to overcome her family's demons and developing love and deep compassion for them. At last, in this memoir she can finally tell the true story of the tragedies and troubles of the Hemingway family, and she delivers a book that beckons comparisons with Mary Karr and Jeanette Walls.",Regan Arts.,288.0,2015.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23280224-out-came-the-sun,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1419212742m/23280224.jpg,"Out Came the Sun: Overcoming the Legacy of Mental Illness, Addiction, and Suicide in My Family",Mariel Hemingway,9781941393239,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Illness', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir']"

A provocative examination of how communications has shaped the language of the media, and vice versa, and how rhetoric shapes how Canadians thinks of themselves as a nation and Canada's engagement in peacekeeping, war, and on the international stage.
According to Richler, each phase of engagement in Afghanistan has been shaped not only by rhetoric but an overarching narrative structure. This topic is very much in discussion at the moment. With the withdrawal of Canadian troops (at least in part) from Afghanistan, it becomes clear there had been a rhetorical cycle. Where once Canada wielded the myth of itself as a peacekeeping nation, the past decade has seen a marked shift away from this, emphasizing the Canadian soldier as warrior. Yet now, as the country withdraws, the oratorical language we use steps away from heroes, able warriors, and sacrifice and back towards a more comfortable vision of Canada in a peacekeeping/training role.
In recent years, Canada has made large financial investments in the apparatus of war -- in a manner it hasn't in a very long time -- and as the realities of war are brought home (the losses, the tragedies, the atrocities, the lasting repercussions that come home with the soldiers who were on the front lines), Richler contends that it's crucial we understand our national perspective on war -- how we have framed it, how we continue to frame it.
Using recent events to bolster his arguments, including the shooting of American congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and the earthquake in Haiti, Richler argues that very possibly the epic narrative of Canada is winding back down to that of the novel as we slowly regain our peacekeeping agenda.",Goose Lane Editions,372.0,2012.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10307660-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-war,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333497186m/10307660.jpg,What We Talk About When We Talk About War,Noah Richler,9780864926227,"['Nonfiction', 'War', 'History']"

Tarquin peremptorily decided to launch the St. John girls en masse into Society--the sooner to be rid of them, Laurie sniffed.

Still our nation's longest running ""cold case,"" the mystery of Elma Sands finally comes to a close with this book, which delivers the first substantial break in the case in over 200 years.
In the closing days of 1799, the United States was still a young republic. Waging a fierce battle for its uncertain future were two political parties: the well-moneyed Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the populist Republicans, led by Aaron Burr. The two finest lawyers in New York, Burr and Hamilton were bitter rivals both in and out of the courtroom, and as the next election approached--with Manhattan likely to be the swing district on which the presidency would hinge--their animosity reached a crescendo. Central to their dispute was the Manhattan water supply, which Burr saw not just as an opportunity to help a city devastated by epidemics but as a chance to heal his battered finances.
But everything changed when Elma Sands, a beautiful young Quaker woman, was found dead in Burr's newly constructed Manhattan Well. The horrific crime quickly gripped the nation, and before long accusations settled on one of Elma's suitors, handsome young carpenter Levi Weeks. As the enraged city demanded a noose be draped around the accused murderer's neck, the only question seemed to be whether Levi would make it to trial or be lynched first.
The young man's only hope was to hire a legal dream team. And thus it was that New York's most bitter political rivals and greatest attorneys did the unthinkable--they teamed up.

Their task was to document the activity of an al Qaeda leader rumored to be very close to Bin Laden with a small army in a Taliban stronghold. Five days later, only one of those Navy SEALS made it out alive.
This is the story of the only survivor of Operation Redwing, SEAL fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, and the extraordinary firefight that led to the largest loss of life in American Navy SEAL history. His squadmates fought valiantly beside him until he was the only one left alive, blasted by an RPG into a place where his pursuers could not find him. Over the next four days, terribly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell crawled for miles through the mountains and was taken in by sympathetic villagers who risked their lives to keep him safe from surrounding Taliban warriors.
A born and raised Texan, Marcus Luttrell takes us from the rigors of SEAL training, where he and his fellow SEALs discovered what it took to join the most elite of the American special forces, to a fight in the desolate hills of Afghanistan for which they never could have been prepared. His account of his squadmates' heroism and mutual support renders an experience that is both heartrending and life-affirming.

""Set my e-reader on fire.""
""I'm wild for all of these boys.""
The WILD Boys of Special Forces is Angel Payne's USA Today bestselling series, raved about by readers and reviewers around the world who love their special ops stories as hot off the mission as on. For the first time ever, you can go WILD with the first three heroes of the set, in their full-length novel glory, all in one specially-priced volume.
Like any good Spec Ops team, these men have an acronym. WILD stands for Warriors Intense in Love and Domination--a job description they take very seriously.
The books in this volume are:
SAVED BY HIS SUBMISSIVE:
Garrett Hawkins is the most valuable asset to his Special Forces unit--because frankly, the guy doesn't care if he lives or dies anymore. Since the love of his life, Sage Weston, was kidnapped and killed a year ago, Garrett has turned the shell of his soul into the armor of a finely-tuned fighting machine.
It's a plan that works--until one night, deep in the jungles of Thailand, he discovers Sage is very much alive. Now that she's back in his arms, Garrett doesn't know what to do. He has changed in dramatic and daunting ways, especially in the darker tastes of his passion. If he touches Sage again, he'll want to claim her, restrain her...dominate her. Is Sage's love strong enough to let Garrett back in not only as her fiance, but her Dominant? Or can it be that Garrett's discipline is exactly what her soul needs to find its way back to life--and love--once again?
HANDCUFFED BY HER HERO:
Between a rock and a hard place. To Sergeant Zeke Hayes, the expression has always been a non-factor. There's never been a situation he can't blast, punch, or smart-ass his way out of, which makes him the perfect fit for his Special Forces battalion--and a natural-born Dominant who's made a lot of submissives happy from Mt. Rainier to Vancouver. That all changes when Rayna Chestain enters his world, and he must harbor her from a fiend who now wants his pound of revenge flesh. Sheltering Rayna has never felt more right--but wanting her? Dreaming of her beneath him, surrendering to his passion and domination? It's the most forbidden fruit he can crave...and the only thing he can't stop thinking about.
SURRENDERING TO HER SERGEANT:
Corporal Ethan Archer has just earned his sergeant's stripes, and the guys on his Special Forces team decide that a trip to the fun and sun of LA is a perfect way to celebrate. When Ethan and his buddies finagle a visit to the set of the successful nighttime drama, ""Dress Blues,"" his reunion with stylist Ava Chestain is magical--but their time is cut short by Bella Lanza, who's determined to rekindle her naughty past with Ethan. Everyone's plans are put on hold when the unit is called to secretly cut their vacation short in the name of assisting the CIA on a terrorist plot to destroy the West Coast. As the terrorists' plan becomes reality, Ethan must make decisions that will either kill or save them all. Can Ava trust him enough to stand by him with everything she is...including what could be her last breath?","Angel Payne Writes, LLC",896.0,2015.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25348779-going-wild,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428877644m/25348779.jpg,Going WILD: The WILD Boys of Special Forces Box Set,Angel Payne,9780991011896,[]

For two decades, while a fearful world prepared for nuclear winter, an elite team of Russian bioweaponeers began to till a new killing field: a bleak tract sown with powerful seeds of mass destruction--by doctors who had committed themselves to creating a biological Armageddon. Biohazardis the never-before-told story of Russia's darkest, deadliest, and most closely guarded Cold War secret.

- Iain Pears, ""New York Times"" bestselling author of ""An Instance of the Fingerpost""
In 1942, at the height of World War II, the famous writer Ernest Hemingway sought permission from the U.S. government to operate a spy ring out of his house in the Cuban countryside. This much is true...
It is the summer of '42, and FBI agent Joe Lucas has come to Cuba at the behest of the Director to keep an eye on Ernest Hemingway, who has recklessly decided to play spy in the Caribbean. Lucas has been instructed to somehow gain the great writer's trust and friendship, but all the agent's cool intellect and training has left him unprepared to withstand the human whirlwind known as ""Papa.""
Hemingway has assembled a spy ring that he calls the ""Crook Factory""--including an American millionaire, a twelve-year-old Cuban orphan, a Spanish jai alai champion, a priest, and a fisherman, among others--to play a dangerous game of amateur espionage. Then, against all odds, Hemingway uncovers a critical piece of intelligence, and the game turns deadly for himself, Lucas, and for untold innocents.
In ""THE CROOK FACTORY,"" Dan Simmons weaves an unforgettable tale of riveting suspense, peopled by larger-than-life characters who inhabit the sensual, intoxicating Cuban landscape of the 1940s. It is a novel of honor, passion, and deadly conspiracy.
And it could very well have happened...
Interestingly, about 75% of the stuff in this book actually happened. The remaining 25% adds an excellent spy story that may havehappened while still fitting all known/revealed facts about Hemingway and his friends in Cuba during WWII.",HarperTorch,580.0,2000.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11535.The_Crook_Factory,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,The Crook Factory,Dan Simmons,9780380789177,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Espionage', 'Suspense']"

As his personal circumstances move in constant flux, Ai Weiwei remains a cultural magnet. Renowned for his political activism and social media activity almost as much as for his social interventions, contemporary approach to the readymade, and knowledge of Chinese traditional crafts, Ai s fame extends throughout and beyond the art world.Drawn from TASCHEN s limited Collector s Edition, this monograph explores each of Ai s career phases up until his release from Chinese custody. It features extensive visual material to trace Ai s development from his early New York days right through to his recent practice. Focus moments include his international breakthrough in the early 2000s, his porcelain Sunflower Seeds at the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern, his response to the Sichuan earthquake of 2008, and his police detention in 2011. With behind-the-scenes studio pictures, production shots, and numerous statements derived from exclusive interviews with Ai, we gain privileged access to the artist s process, influences, and importance.The book includes texts from Uli Sigg, Ai s longtime friend and former Swiss ambassador to China; Roger M. Buergel, who curated the 2007 documentary and hosted the artist s Fairytale piece; and experts on Chinese culture and politics: Carlos Rojas, William A. Callahan, and James J. Lally.

-- John Ziman, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Bristol, and Fellow of the Royal Society. ""The fish's streamlined shape reveals functional knowledge of the physical properties of water.... The deadly effectiveness of the cobra's venom shows useful knowledge of the physiology of its prey.... Indeed, knowledge itself may be broadly conceived as the fit of some aspect of an organism to some aspect of its environment, whether it be the fit of the butterfly's long siphon of a mouth to the flowers from which it feeds or the fit of the astrophysicist's theories to the structure of the universe. ... But how did such remarkable instances of fit arise? How did the animate world obtain its impressive knowledge of its surroundings? And how do organisms continue to acquire knowledge and thereby increase their fit during their lifetimes?"" In this sweeping account of the emergence of fit, Gary Cziko integrates numerous scientific disciplines within the perspective of a universal selection theory that attempts to account for all cases of fit involving living organisms, including those that might appear miraculous. Cziko's bold assertion is that all novel forms of adapted complexity -- whether single-celled organisms or scientific theories -- emerge from an evolutionary process involving cumulative blind variation and selection.
Without Miracles describes many remarkable examples of the fit of various structures, behaviors, and products of living organisms to their environmentsin a broad synthesis of humankind's attempt to understand the emergence of complex, adapted entities. These explanations range from the providential accounts of the early philosophers and ""natural theologians, "" through instructionist theories of the type proposed by Lamarck, to an ongoing ""second Darwinian revolution"" in which natural and artificial selection are being applied to many fields of science to both explain the emergence of naturally occurring adapted complexity and to facilitate the design of useful products ranging from microbes to computer programs.",Bradford Book,399.0,1997.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/878848.Without_Miracles,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,Without Miracles: Universal Selection Theory and the Second Darwinian Revolution,Gary Cziko,9780262531474,[]

1123,2544,eng,3.79,"Spinrad made his biggest SF splash with Bug Jack Barron, whose 1967/68 New Worldsserialisation brought raging controversy which Michael Moorcock discusses in an afterword. It's a quintessential 60s novel, prophetically highlighting the irresponsible power of mass media & corporations.
TV megastar Jack Barron hosts the wildly popular Bug Jack Barron, a phone-in show that listens to public gripes & puts politicians & bosses on the spot--live. Naturally Barron pulls his punches for safety's sake--until he tangles with paranoid billionaire Benedict Howards, peddler of cryonic immortality, & walks into a minefield of deadly cover-ups. Violence erupts. Howards believes he can buy anyone, even Barron's estranged wife, even Barron. Barron doesn't mind selling out if the coin is immortality. On TV, the power remains his: ""As they rolled the final commercial Barron felt a weird manic exhilaration, knowing that he'd set up a focus of forces that could squash the five-hundred-billion-dollar Foundation for Human Immortality like a bug if Bennie proved dumb enough to not holler Uncle."" The Foundation's medical secret--poor science but still packing a vicious gut-punch--is more appalling than Barron's nastiest guesses. By the time he learns the truth he's ensnared in complicity. Worse things follow. At the climax, with nothing left to lose, our man goes for broke in a desperate effort to crack Howards open in Barron's own glowing TV arena, in front of 100 million viewers.

They and their five children work relentlessly to tame their patch of land, buying saplings from a local tree man known as John Appleseed so they can cultivate the fifty apple trees required to stake their claim on the property. But the orchard they plant sows the seeds of a long battle. James loves the apples, reminders of an easier life back in Connecticut; while Sadie prefers the applejack they make, an alcoholic refuge from brutal frontier life.

1182,2656,eng,3.67,"In Neuroscience and Philosophythree prominent philosophers and a leading neuroscientist clash over the conceptual presuppositions of cognitive neuroscience. The book begins with an excerpt from Maxwell Bennett and Peter Hacker's Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience(Blackwell, 2003), which questions the conceptual commitments of cognitive neuroscientists. Their position is then criticized by Daniel Dennett and John Searle, two philosophers who have written extensively on the subject, and Bennett and Hacker in turn respond.
Their impassioned debate encompasses a wide range of central themes: the nature of consciousness, the bearer and location of psychological attributes, the intelligibility of so-called brain maps and representations, the notion of qualia, the coherence of the notion of an intentional stance, and the relationships between mind, brain, and body. Clearly argued and thoroughly engaging, the authors present fundamentally different conceptions of philosophical method, cognitive-neuroscientific explanation, and human nature, and their exchange will appeal to anyone interested in the relation of mind to brain, of psychology to neuroscience, of causal to rational explanation, and of consciousness to self-consciousness.
In his conclusion Daniel Robinson (member of the philosophy faculty at Oxford University and Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University) explains why this confrontation is so crucial to the understanding of neuroscientific research. The project of cognitive neuroscience, he asserts, depends on the incorporation of human nature into the framework of science itself. In Robinson's estimation, Dennett and Searle fail to support this undertaking; Bennett and Hacker suggest that the project itself might be based on a conceptual mistake.

Do circles ever get squared?
In Fortuna's Bastard Matt Feargal was forced to confront a devastating family history. His inability to do so, decisively, led directly to the fall-out of End Times Inc. During the road-trip across the Americas, that was End Times, Matt searched for any rumour of his family lost to his father's megalomania.
Matt began to understand it wasn't simply his family that was at risk, but the world itself. The choices he made, the actions he took, and the hope he refused to surrender have led to this final and desperate race across North America. Taking a new view of the Apocalypse and its culture, Matt, China Bob, and the Cinn are forced to fight for their own beliefs about what the world is and to whom it belongs.
In a final attempt to rescue his family and save their world Apocalypse Culture takes Matt from Mexico to the Michigan peninsula, and a final confrontation in a secret cavern in southern California.

Annabel Grey has been brought up to be a very proper Victorian young lady. But being 'proper' isn't always easy - especially when you can sometimes see marvellous (as well as terrifying) things in puddles. But parlour tricks such as these are nothing compared to the world that Annabel is about to enter...
After the rather sudden departure of her mother, Annabel is sent to live with her aunts. They claim to be Shoreditch witches, and from a very old family line of them too. They're keen to introduce Annabel to their world of transformation, potions and flying broomsticks (which seem to have strong personalities of their own) but are horrified when Annabel announces not only does she not know any magic, young ladies shouldn't believe in such things. But before Annabel has time to decide whether she does or not, she is swept into an urgent quest.
The trees of Highgate have been whispering to Kitty - an extraordinary urchin of a girl, who Annabel's aunts seem very fond of - and so have the fairies. They talk of a terrible, dark magic that wants to devour all of London. And of a most magical girl who might be able to stop it . . .

The words ""Murmansk Run"" conjure visions of ice-laden ships and thoughts of freezing to death in seconds. For five long years, thousands of men and women fought ferociously in the coldest corner of hell on earth. Some fought for survival, some struggled to help others survive, and some sought to crush their enemies. If man-made death didn't get you, the Arctic's weapons of ice and cold would. These natural weapons killed regardless of whose side you were on or how just was your cause. No one escaped unscathed. Author Mike Walling captures the Arctic convoys' bitter essence in Forgotten Sacrifice.
The story launches in October 1939, when Germany and the Soviet Union began diplomatic maneuvering. The action accelerates with Winston Churchill's decision in 1941 to provide supplies to Soviet forces battling the German invasion. From this point until the closing days of WWII in spring 1945, an unremitting sea battle raged within the confines of the always-lethal, ever-shifting Arctic ice pack and the savage Scandinavian coastline. Nearly 4.5 million tons of supplies were moved in 77 convoys over the course of 5 years in order to help the Soviet war effort. The Allies fought to keep the sea lanes open to Murmansk while the Germans were determined to slaughter every ship which dared to make the attempt. By the end of the convoys, 98 ships had been lost.

This is the true story of the pursuit and capture of a serial killer in the heart of the Third Reich. 
For all appearances, Paul Ogorzow was a model German. An employed family man, party member, and sergeant in the infamous Brownshirts, he had worked his way up in the Berlin railroad from a manual laborer laying track to assistant signalman. But he also had a secret need to harass and frighten women. Then he was given a gift from the Nazi high command.
Due to Allied bombing raids, a total blackout was instituted throughout Berlin, including on the commuter trains--trains often used by women riding home alone from the factories.
Under cover of darkness and with a helpless flock of victims to choose from, Ogorzow's depredations grew more and more horrific. He escalated from simply frightening women to physically attacking them, eventually raping and murdering them. Beginning in September 1940, he started casually tossing their bodies off the moving train. Though the Nazi party tried to censor news of the attacks, the women of Berlin soon lived in a state of constant fear.

1214,2721,eng,3.75,"A vibrant social history set against the backdrop of the Antebellum south and the Civil War that recreates the lives and friendship of two exceptional women: First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and her mulatto dressmaker, Elizabeth Keckly.
I consider you my best living friend,Mary Lincoln wrote to Elizabeth Keckly in 1867, and indeed theirs was a close if tumultuous, relationship. Born into slavery, mulatto Elizabeth Keckly was Mary Lincoln's dressmaker, confidante, and mainstay during the difficult years that the Lincolns occupied the White House and the early years of Mary's widowhood. But she was a fascinating woman in her own right, independent and already well-established as the dressmaker to the Washington elite when she was first hired by Mary Lincoln upon her arrival in the nation's capital. Lizzy had bought her freedom in 1855 and come to Washington determined to make a life for herself as a free black, and she soon had Washington correspondents reporting that ""stately carriages stand before her door, whose haughty owners sit before Lizzy docile as lambs while she tells them what to wear."" Mary Lincoln had hired Lizzy in part because she was considered a ""high society"" seamstress and Mary, an outsider in Washington's social circles, was desperate for social cachet. With her husband struggling to keep the nation together, Mary turned increasingly to her seamstress for companionship, support, and advice--and over the course of those trying years, Lizzy Keckly became her confidante and closest friend.
With ""Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly,"" pioneering historian Jennifer Fleischner allows us to glimpse the intimate dynamics of this unusual friendship for the first time, and traces the pivotal events that enabled these two women--one born to be a mistress, the other to be a slave--to forge such an unlikely bond at a time when relations between blacks and whites were tearing the nation apart. Beginning with their respective childhoods in the slaveholding states of Virginia and Kentucky, their story takes us through the years of tragic Civil War, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the early Reconstruction period. An author in her own right, Keckly wrote one of the most detailed biographies of Mary Lincoln ever published, and though it led to a bitter feud between the friends, it is one of the many rich resources that have enhanced Fleischner's trove of original findings.
A remarkable, riveting work of scholarship that reveals the legacy of slavery and sheds new light on the Lincoln White House, Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Kecklybrings to life a mesmerizing, intimate aspect of Civil War history, and underscores the inseparability of black and white in our nation's heritage.",Broadway,384.0,2003.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/868352.Mrs_Lincoln_and_Mrs_Keckly,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328271669m/868352.jpg,Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly: The Remarkable Story of the Friendship Between a First Lady and a Former Slave,Jennifer Fleischner,9780767902588,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'American History', 'Civil War', 'Politics', 'American Civil War']"

Might the path to true knowledge of any great dictator lead through his stomach?
What did dictators eat? Sometimes simply obscene amounts of the best their nations could offer, but more often their despots' humble origins, or embarrassing medical conditions, or simple lack of interest in or time for food meant their tastes were surprisingly unpretentious--ranging from human flesh, to raw garlic salad, to Quality Street . . .
Dictators' Dinners is an investigation into what some of the world's most notorious twentieth-century despots have enjoyed most at their dinner table, and with whom. Here we learn of their foibles, their eccentricities and their frequent terror of poisoning--something no number of food tasters was ever able to assuage.

Some aspects of the author's life and text seem curiously modern. She married at age thirty-three and identified herself as a reader and writer more than as a wife and mother. Enthralled by romantic fiction, she wrote extensively about the disillusioning blows that reality can deal to fantasy. The Sarashina Diaryis a portrait of the writer as reader and an exploration of the power of reading to shape one's expectations and aspirations.
As a person and an author, this writer presages the medieval era in Japan with her deep concern for Buddhist belief and practice. Her narrative's main thread follows a trajectory from youthful infatuation with romantic fantasy to the disillusionment of age and concern for the afterlife; yet, at the same time, many passages erase the dichotomy between literary illusion and spiritual truth. This new translation captures the lyrical richness of the original text while revealing its subtle structure and ironic meaning. The introduction highlights the poetry in the Sarashina Diaryand the juxtaposition of poetic passages and narrative prose, which brings meta-meanings into play. The translators' commentary offers insight into the author's family and world, as well as the fascinating textual legacy of her work.",Columbia University Press,239.0,2014.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19144990-the-sarashina-diary,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389597804m/19144990.jpg,The Sarashina Diary: A Woman's Life in Eleventh-Century Japan,Lady Sarashina,9780231167185,"['Japan', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Japanese Literature', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Poetry']"

The novel of a strong and beautiful woman who broke all the rules of the American frontier...
Sophie Dymond had overcome nineteenth-century prejudices to succeed as publisher of a hugely popular women's magazine. But when she left New York to revisit her native Wyoming, where her sister had died mysteriously, she left her prestige and power far behind. Waiting for Sophie was a world where women were treated either as decorative figurines or as abject sexual vassals...where wives were led to despise the marriage act and prostitutes pandered to husbands' hungers...where the relationship between women and men became a kind of guerilla warfare in which women were forced to band together for the strength they needed and at times for the love they wanted. In her effort to grasp the meaning of her sister's life and death, Sophie discovers the secret that tainted her life and begins to understand the experience of the vast majority of silent, trapped women.

Death was right around the corner...
Dillon didn't take his eyes off the exit to the dark alley. He went on, keeping his gun ready. The open street ahead of him, the deep shadows, and the knowledge that death was waiting for him made his nerves tingle.
Quite suddenly two men sprang into the alley. Dillon could see them outlined against a street light. Instantly, he started firing before his brain telegraphed to his hand.

A primer for the student and for the scientific amateur, this well-illustrated volume presents a general and up-to-date view of some of the world's most complex natural environments. In addition, it provides the neotropical specialist with a broad look at the entire field of neotropical biology.
After giving an overview of the different kinds of ecosystems in the tropics, the author describes the structure, function, and evolution of tropical rain forests. Tropical trees are then discussed, as are the vast array of vines, orchids, bromeliads, and other plants that live among the branches of the forest giants. A chapter on the ""tropical pharmacy"" treats the many drugs present in tropical vegetation and the evolutionary influence of these drugs. The book surveys the great diversity of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and arthropods of the neotropics and provides separate chapters on tropical savannas and on coastal ecosystems. An epilogue deals with the crucially important issues of the conservation of neotropical environments.",Princeton University Press,448.0,1990.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/695670.A_Neotropical_Companion,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1298410137m/695670.jpg,"A Neotropical Companion: An Introduction to the Animals, Plants, and Ecosystems of the New World Tropics",John C.

College is a time for figuring out who you want to be, what you want to do, but as she tries to adjust to the unfamiliar environment, she realizes she's led a pretty sheltered life. Embracing the college culture isn't as easy as she expected it to be. It doesn't help that sometimes things--and people--aren't what they seem, especially her roommate.

1274,2853,eng,3.69,"From the shuttered factories of the rust belt to the look-alike strip malls of the sun belt--and almost everywhere in between--America has been transformed by its relentless fixation on low price. This pervasive yet little examined obsession is arguably the most powerful and devastating market force of our time--the engine of globalization, outsourcing, planned obsolescence, and economic instability in an increasingly unsettled world.
Low price is so alluring that we may have forgotten how thoroughly we once distrusted it. Ellen Ruppel Shell traces the birth of the bargain as we know it from the Industrial Revolution to the assembly line and beyond, homing in on a number of colorful characters, such as Gene Verkauf (his name is Yiddish for ""to sell""), founder of E. J. Korvette, the discount chain that helped wean customers off traditional notions of value. The rise of the chain store in post-Depression America led to the extolling of convenience over quality, and big-box retailers completed the reeducation of the American consumer by making them prize low price in the way they once prized durability and craftsmanship.
The effects of this insidious perceptual shift are vast: a blighted landscape, escalating debt (both personal and national), stagnating incomes, fraying communities, and a host of other socioeconomic ills. That's a long list of charges, and it runs counter to orthodox economics, which argues that low price powers productivity by stimulating a brisk free market. But Shell marshals evidence from a wide range of fields--history, sociology, marketing, psychology, even economics itself--to upend the conventional wisdom. Cheapalso unveils the fascinating and unsettling illogic that underpins our bargain-hunting reflex and explains how our deep-rooted need for bargains colors every aspect of our psyches and social lives. In this myth-shattering, closely reasoned, and exhaustively reported investigation, Shell exposes the astronomically high cost of cheap.",Tantor Media,0.0,2009.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6598463-cheap,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328773065m/6598463.jpg,Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture,Ellen Ruppel Shell,9781400112791,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Politics']"

1278,2870,eng,4.17,"Before there was money, there was debt
Every economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systems--to relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? There's not a shred of evidence to support it.
Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods--that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.
Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like ""guilt,"" ""sin,"" and ""redemption"") derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it.

Phoenix Coyotes brawler Paul Bisonette said ""I'm not really afraid of anyone, but if I were to fight him, I'd probably be shaking going in."" Ask Laraque, though, and he'd say that's not who he is. Known as a player who was unfailingly respectful and gentlemanly even when he was going toe-to-toe with the toughest guys in the toughest league in the world, today Laraque takes that courageous sense of what is fair into fights that are much more important than the outcome of a hockey game. The son of Haitian immigrants, Laraque campaigns for World Vision to help with Haitian relief. A committed believer in animal rights (and probably the toughest vegan in the world), Laraque is a spokesperson for PETA. A conscientious environmentalist, Laraque stepped up to be the deputy leader of the Green Party. In this intimate, often surprising, biography, Laraque tells the story of a hockey player's life that is unlike any other, from a childhood facing racism in Quebec's minor hockey system, to the thrill of the Stanley Cup Finals as an Edmonton Oiler, and sharing a dressing room with Sidney Crosby--and from dropping the gloves on the ice to refusing to back back down from much more serious fights off the ice.

Karigan G'ladheon had been a Green Rider, one of the king of Sacoridia's elite magical messengers. Being a Green Rider was more perilous than Karigan had ever imagined, for a rogue Eletians had cracked the magical D'Yer Wall which had protected Sacoridia for a thousand years from the evil influence of Blackveil Forest--the arboreal prison of Sacoridia's ancient enemy Mornhaven the Black--and had brought the threat of dark magic into the land. In the messenger service she had been caught up in a world of deadly danger, and though she had defeated the Eletian, she had nonetheless been tainted by his wild magic.

How bad would it have to be?
And what if she can't turn to God because she believes He's the root of all her problems?
Set among the fragrant sweet smell of ripening orange tree blossoms, this emotional story is about a woman who battles God for the right to determine how things should be. Gabriella's life has been filled with tragedy, including the mystery of why her own parents disappeared one night, leaving her alone at a tender young age. Soon after her husband dies, she and her son move to her childhood home--a house on a cliff by the sea in a village that time has left behind. It's there that she and some local villagers begin the process of bringing her parent's old orange grove back to life.
As Gabriella begins to put together the pieces of why her parents abandoned her, she soon learns they were victims of powerful forces that threatened to tear apart the quiet little village by the sea. And that knowledge, along with all the other losses she's experienced, causes Gabriella to view God with great suspicion and fear. So when her young son experiences a dramatic conversion and begins to serve Him, an all-out battle ensues.
During this time, Gabriella often feels called to the edge of the cliff, torn between letting herself slip over it and ending the pain, or fighting for a happiness she's not even sure exists. Will Gabriella continue to do battle with God? Or will she come to have faith in the God she blames for all the tragedies she's suffered?
And what role will her young son play in her decision?
This book considers questions like: What happens when God doesn't act like we think He should? And Can someone who has experienced so much pain and disappointment ever really let go of the hurt and learn to trust Him?

A conflict we will never see.
One woman stands between those determined to control history and those who will risk their lives for freedom.
Maya is hiding in plain sight in London. The twenty-six-year-old has abandoned the dangerous obligations pressed upon her by her father, and chosen instead to live a normal life. But Maya comes from a long line of people who call themselves Harlequins--a fierce group of warriors willing to sacrifice their lives to protect a select few known as Travelers.
Gabriel and Michael Corrigan are brothers living in Los Angeles. Since childhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father was a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced the course of history. Travelers are able to attain pure enlightenment, and have for centuries ushered change into the world. Gabriel and Michael, who may have inherited their father's gifts, have always protected themselves by living ""off the Grid""--that is, invisible to the real-life surveillance networks that monitor people in our modern society.
Summoned by her ailing father, Maya is told of the existence of the brothers. The Corrigans are in severe danger, stalked by powerful men known as the Tabula--ruthless mercenaries who have hunted Travelers for generations. This group is determined to inflict order on the world by controlling it, and they view Travelers as an intolerable threat. As Maya races to California to protect the brothers, she is reluctantly pulled back into the cold and solitary Harlequin existence. A colossal battle looms--one that will reveal not only the identities of Gabriel and Michael Corrigan but also a secret history of our time.
Moving from the back alleys of Prague to the heart of Los Angeles, from the high deserts of Arizona to a guarded research facility in New York, The Traveler explores a parallel world that exists alongside our own. John Twelve Hawks's stunningly suspenseful debut is an international publishing sensation that marks the arrival of a major new talent.

The Rich Boy --
The Bridal Party --
The Last of the Belles.
Fitzgerald's short story ""The Rich Boy"" (like his novel The Great Gatsby) utilizes an outside narrator to tell the story of a wealthy protagonist in a sympathetic but still somewhat distanced way. Here the protagonist is Anson Hunter, a well-to-do young New Yorker, who would seem to have the whole world ahead of him and the streets paved in gold.
By his early twenties, he has found his ideal woman as well: the exquisite -- and very rich -- Paula Legendre. On the surface, Paula would not seem to be the type of girl that would exert such a pull on Anson. Anson seems to have a lot of oats to sow, and Fitzgerald describes Paula as being ""conservative and rather proper."" But he is, nonetheless, obsessed by her, not because she represents the money he wants -- after all, he already has enough of his own -- but because she represents the social system that justifies his existence. In his world, responsible older men (like his uncle Robert) hold the reins of government and business; chaste and proper women (like Paula and her mother) maintain the rules of propriety and etiquette; and, until they get old enough to assume the mantle of responsible older manhood, playboys like Anson play. That is all Anson thinks he is doing right now. Just as he sees in himself the undeveloped kernel of a future leader, he sees in Paula the kernel of a future society matron. He thinks they would make a good pair.
What he doesn't realize, however, is that his virtually unlimited wealth has within it the power to corrupt him, and it's already doing a good job. His first problem is that he sees himself as superior. He carries himself that way; Fitzgerald says that "". . . He had a confident charm and a certain brusque style, and the upper-class men who passed him on the street knew without being told that he was a rich boy and had gone to one of the best schools. . . . Anson accepted without reservation the world of high finance and high extravagance, of divorce and dissipation, of snobbery and of privilege.""
Anson doesn't see any reason why, being young and rich, he has to play by anyone else's rules. If he wants to drink himself under the table, why shouldn't he have the right to do that? And regardless of where or with whom he happens to be when he acts drunkenly, or obscenely, or boorishly, why should he apologize for his behavior? He's rich, and the rich make the rules, don't they? People should just accept his natural superiority, regardless of how he behaves.
It would seem very difficult to sympathize with a character who holds these beliefs and acts upon them so wholeheartedly; but we do, because we sense that he is headed for a fall. His first mistake lies in his inability to commit himself to Paula. Fate gave Anson every opportunity to take Paula as his own. In doing so, he would be asserting his adulthood; he would be taking his place alongside the other well-to-do movers and shakers of New York. But, true to his status as a tragic hero, he constantly tries to defy fate. The role ordained for him is to be a wealthy, responsible scion of business, a lord of some suburban manor, the benefactor of deserving charities; for far too long, he refuses. Anson doesn't want to grow up. He gets a job, ""entering a brokerage house, joining half a dozen clubs, [and] dancing late."" Even as he moves up the corporate ladder, there is still that part of him that is unable to give up the schoolboy carousing, the indifference toward the responsibilities that fate has laid upon his shoulders as the wages of being rich.
His second mistake is in self-righteously condemning his aunt Edna for having an affair. Anson, of all people, ought to be the last person to condemn anyone for moral lapses, and certainly not lapses of the heart; Anson's heart is far more lapsed than Edna and Cary's. He himself had just broken up with Dolly Karger, whom he dated all the while knowing she meant nothing to him, and her careless behavior merely mirrored his own. He has no right to threaten to expose Edna and Cary, and he is thus directly responsible for Cary's suicide. But ""Anson never blamed himself for his part in the affair [because he believed] the situation which brought it about had not been of his making."" But there, of course, he is wrong.
His third mistake lies in the belief that when he is ready, Paula will be waiting. He is disturbed when he hears she has married someone else, but, as we have pointed out, Anson lives in a world characterized by ""divorce and dissipation"", and he seems to feel Paula will come around on his timetable. What this basically amounts to is a belief that fate is on his side; it must be, because he was born rich. But the overriding lesson of Anson's life is that of those to whom much is given, much is asked. Anson does not seem to realize that payback is a lifelong process.

This is the first international publication in which the San of today step forward to tell their own story in their own words.

The interviews they transcribed present the spirit of their communities and highlight the traditional differences and similarities between the groups, the shared history of suffering, and their desire and enthusiasm for life and most of all, freedom. Voices of the San provides a glimpse into the hundreds of broad, open-ended discussions held amongst the San themselves. It begins with the story of this book and is then divided into four chapters covering the themes they themselves identified as reflecting their current existence.All of this is richly and beautifully illustrated with over 300 photographs, contemporary artworks and drawings.

His town is Rocksburg, a small coal mining town in western Pennsylvania where most of the coal has run out. In this, his fifth case, tomatoes curiously ripening out of season are the key. It begins at Muscotti's Bar, Balzic's refuge, when Jimmy Romanelli sells several baskets of tomatoes to Vinnie, Muscotti's barkeep.

1334,3024,eng,4.03,"Archeofuturism, an important work in the tradition of the European New Right, is finally now available in English. Challenging many assumptions held by the Right, this book generated much debate when it was first published in French in 1998. Faye believes that the future of the Right requires a transcendence of the division between those who wish for a restoration of the traditions of the past, and those who are calling for new social and technological forms - creating a synthesis which will amplify the strengths and restrain the excesses of both: Archeofuturism. Faye also provides a critique of the New Right; an analysis of the continuing damage being done by Western liberalism, political inertia, unrestrained immigration and ethnic self-hatred; and the need to abandon past positions and dare to face the realities of the present in order to realise the ideology of the future. He prophesises a series of catastrophes between 2010 and 2020, brought about by the unsustainability of the present world order, which he asserts will offer an opportunity to rebuild the West and put Archeofuturism into practice on a grand scale. This book is a must-read for anyone concerned with the course that the Right must chart in order to deal with the increasing crises and challenges it will face in the coming decades. Guillaume Faye was one of the principal members of the famed French New Right organisation GRECE in the 1970s and '80s. After departing in 1986 due to his disagreement with its strategy, he had a successful career on French television and radio before returning to the stage of political philosophy as a powerful alternative voice with the publication of Archeofuturism. Since then he has continued to challenge the status quo within the Right in his writings, earning him both the admiration and disdain of his colleagues.",Arktos Media Ltd,252.0,2010.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9436017-archeofuturism,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340792343m/9436017.jpg,Archeofuturism,Guillaume Faye,9781907166099,"['Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Futurism', 'Far Right', 'History', 'France']"

It revolves around the intertwined lives of Ray, a leading neurosurgeon, sharp and flamboyant proprietor and driving force of Chetna, India's foremost coma clinic and Dr Aman Kapoor, reputed physician and accident victim who falls into a coma.
Aman becomes Ray's unsuspecting guinea pig- Ray and his American collaborators successfully implant a silicon chip inside Aman's brain- true to the book's sci-fi genre, a robot does does the operation!
Aman wakes up- rejuvenated and changed forever. As Ray and his team expected, his brain has been enhanced to superlative degrees but his body suffers strange illnesses, a result of conflict between the material chip and corporeal brain.
The story is about how Aman manages to trace his bizarre bodily symptoms and sudden miraculous healing powers to his brain operation at Chetna with help from Manasi, his psychiatrist, and her journalist friend, Ishan. Ray finally buckles to emotional pressure from Manasi and his own daughter, the irrepressible Sakhi and has to undo the wrong he had done by trying to play God.

1337,3030,eng,3.99,"Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America's rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his ""World's Fair Hotel"" just west of the fairgrounds--a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.
TheDevil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. In this book the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before.

American military bases encircle the globe. More than two decades after the end of the Cold War, the U.S. still stations its troops at nearly a thousand locations in foreign lands. These bases are usually taken for granted or overlooked entirely, a little-noticed part of the Pentagon's vast operations. But in an eye-opening account, Base Nationshows that the worldwide network of bases brings with it a panoply of ills--and actually makes the nation less safe in the long run.
As David Vine demonstrates, the overseas bases raise geopolitical tensions and provoke widespread antipathy towards the United States. They also undermine American democratic ideals, pushing the U.S. into partnerships with dictators and perpetuating a system of second-class citizenship in territories like Guam. They breed sexual violence, destroy the environment, and damage local economies. And their financial cost is staggering: though the Pentagon underplays the numbers, Vine's accounting proves that the bill approaches $100 billion per year.
For many decades, the need for overseas bases has been a quasi-religious dictum of U.S. foreign policy. But in recent years, a bipartisan coalition has finally started to question this conventional wisdom. With the U.S. withdrawing from Afghanistan and ending thirteen years of war, there is no better time to re-examine the tenets of our military strategy. Base Nationis an essential contribution to that debate.",Metropolitan Books,418.0,2015.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22320467-base-nation,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428639064m/22320467.jpg,Base Nation:  How U.S. Military Bases Abroad Harm America and the World,David Vine,9781627791694,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Politics', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'Economics', 'Historical']"

""Alby is Holden Caulfield in the Internet age..."" --Los Angeles Times
Hailed as ""indelible"" by Entertainment Weekly, a ""cringe-inducingly funny"" (The Wall Street Journal)gut-punch of a debut about love, grief, and family ""unleashes one of the most comically arresting voices this side of Sam Lipsyte's Homeland"" (Publishers Weekly, starred review)
In Matt Sumell's blazing first book, our hero Alby flails wildly against the world around him--he punches his sister (she deserved it), ""unprotectos"" broads (they deserved it and liked it), gets drunk and picks fights (all deserved), defends defenseless creatures both large and small, and spews insults at children, slow drivers, old ladies, and every single surviving member of his family. In each of these stories Alby distills the anguish, the terror, the humor, and the strange grace--or lack of--he experiences in the aftermath of his mother's death. Swirling at the center of Alby's rage is a grief so big, so profound, it might swallow him whole. As he drinks, screws, and jokes his way through his pain and heartache, Alby's anger, his kindness, and his capacity for good bubble up when he (and we) least expect it. Sumell delivers ""a naked rendering of a heart sorting through its broken pieces to survive.*""
Making Niceis a powerful, full-steam-ahead ride that will keep you laughing even as you try to catch your breath; a new classic about love, loss, and the fine line between grappling through grief and fighting for (and with) the only family you've got.

Scientists turn to natural selection, genes or adaptation to explain the living world, but the imagery of evolution threatens to distort our understanding of the incredible history of our planet.

The Mythology of Evolution exposes seven 'spins' given to evolutionary theory, each resting upon an ideological interpretation of an otherwise neutral idea. There are myths of progress and destiny, such as the 'ladder of progress' and 'only the strong survive'. There are stories magnifying the significance of genes such as 'the selfish gene' or 'kin selection'. There are more grandiose myths such as 'survival of the fittest' and the infamous 'intelligent design'. All relate to a final myth - that of 'science as truth'.

After surviving four years with a commitment-phobic boyfriend, Elizabeth wants nothing more than to settle down. Too bad the man she desires, Marshall Roderick, leaves her flustered, trembling, and unable to utter a single word when he's near.
Assuming he's the very definition of a womanizing bachelor, Elizabeth relegates him to fantasyland and makes no move to get to know him. That is, until a chance encounter along the shores of Lake Superior leads to drinks and a steamy romance.
Confident, successful, and freakishly handsome, Marshall is everything Elizabeth has been looking for. But when an unthinkable act of violence shakes them both to the core, she discovers that Marshall isn't as carefree and put-together as he led her to believe.
Now it's up to Marshall and Elizabeth to figure out if their love can heal the scars of the past and turn them into the people they've always wanted to be.",Wise Ink Publishing,281.0,2014.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23002593-it-will-always-be-you,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408543359m/23002593.jpg,It Will Always Be You (You #1),Tina Ness,9781940014456,"['Romance', 'Contemporary Romance']"

Los Angeles Police Detective Ed Browning intended to write off the death of actor Leslie Clover as an accident until Maisy said she could prove the man was murdered. To top that off, she bet him she could solve the murder before he could. Browning took the bet and the contest was on to catch a killer. Browning only had a bunch of inexperienced, clumsy, bungling cops to help him, while Maisy had the aid of silent screen actress and comedy queen Mabel Normand. The detective and the actress went to the wire nose-to-nose in their race to solve the crime and needed a photo finish to determine the winner.

You Must Read brings together more than thirty well-known Christian leaders and gives them the opportunity to talk about a book that has made a lasting impact on their lives. Their personal narratives and recommendations of the literature that has moulded and matured them combine to produce a book full of interest from start to finish, but also one that can be 'dipped into' for occasional reading. Best of all, You Must Read will be an indispensable guide to some of the truly great books that have transformed, encouraged, instructed and challenged countless Christians' lives. You Must Read is a 'must read' in itself, and a marvelous stimulus to read more.
You Must Read is an ambiguous title. As Christians 'we are what we read'. God's word is the instrument by which the Holy Spirit renews our minds and transforms our lives. The same is true, to a lesser extent, of Christian literature. The biographies of Christians whose lives have left a permanent mark on the church often disclose the influence of a particular book, or books, they themselves have read. So, You Must Read is a perennial maxim. You really must read!
But we also use these words when we are enthusiastic about a good book. We instinctively ask our friends, 'Have you read ...?' And if the answer is 'no' we tend to say 'Oh, you must read ...'
But where do you begin? There are so many books from which to choose. Many of us want to ask, 'Can somebody please tell me what books I should read?' You Must Read provides some answers from the pens of a number of well-known Christian leaders, including Joel R. Beeke, Alistair Begg, Jerry Bridges, Mark Dever, J. Ligon Duncan, R.

Stepping into his cousin's BDSM club is a reminder that there is another part of himself. A part that has been left empty in a life ruled by work. The fact is, he's a Dom in search of a sub.

Terryn is the sub of his dreams, with the power to ease his soul.

She was an only child who grew up with the best private schools, debutante balls, and a home in Hancock Park, Los Angeles's old-money enclave. But beneath the family's facade of ""keeping up appearances,"" Hope hid a host of ugly truths, including a mother increasingly jealous of her daughter's good looks, an uncle's sexual advances, and a father who cowed to the demands of his wife and coolly reserved parents. Hope became addicted to a quest for physical perfection in place of her self-esteem--, and by the age of twenty-seven she had undergone seven plastic surgeries. In riveting, unflinching prose, Hope recounts her downward spiral that alienated her family and friends, and led her to theft, bankruptcy, and a sadistic relationship before she began her recovery. A powerful response to a culture obsessed with extreme makeovers and risky procedures that promise flawlessness, Beautiful Strangeris a timely, cautionary tale. Her story will inspire the countless women and men like her who struggle every day in a culture that feeds us dangerous images of unattainable perfection. Beautiful Strangeris a dark, scary, and important story of how broad social trends shape the suffering of individuals; how, in the author's case, the beauty addiction of a whole culture is mapped onto a dysfunctional family and an obsessive compulsive disorder.

Success, true love, and the life you've always wanted. Many of us placed our faith in these things, believing they held the key to happiness, but with a sneaking suspicion they might not deliver. The recent economic meltdown has cast a harsh new light on these pursuits. In a matter of months, fortunes, marriages, careers, and a secure retirement have disappeared for millions of people. No wonder so many of us feel lost, alone, disenchanted, and resentful. But the truth is that we made lesser gods of these good things--gods that can't give us what we really need. There is only one God who can wholly satisfy our cravings--and now is the perfect time to meet him again, or for the first time.
The Bible tells us that the human heart is an ""idol-factory,"" taking good things and making them into idols that drive us. In Counterfeit Gods, Keller applies his trademark approach to show us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the unvarnished truth about societal ideals and our own hearts.

1416,3188,eng,3.9,"B95 can feel it: a stirring in his bones and feathers. It's time. Today is the day he will once again cast himself into the air, spiral upward into the clouds, and bank into the wind.
He wears a black band on his lower right leg and an orange flag on his upper left, bearing the laser inscription B95. Scientists call him the Moonbird because, in the course of his astoundingly long lifetime, this gritty, four-ounce marathoner has flown the distance to the moon--and halfway back!
B95 is a robin-sized shorebird, a red knot of the subspecies rufa. Each February he joins a flock that lifts off from Tierra del Fuego, headed for breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic, nine thousand miles away. Late in the summer, he begins the return journey.
B95 can fly for days without eating or sleeping, but eventually he must descend to refuel and rest. However, recent changes at ancient refueling stations along his migratory circuit--changes caused mostly by human activity--have reduced the food available and made it harder for the birds to reach. And so, since 1995, when B95 was first captured and banded, the worldwide rufa population has collapsed by nearly 80 percent. Most perish somewhere along the great hemispheric circuit, but the Moonbird wings on. He has been seen as recently as November 2011, which makes him nearly twenty years old. Shaking their heads, scientists ask themselves: How can this one bird make it year after year when so many others fall?
National Book Award-winning author Phillip Hoose takes us around the hemisphere with the world's most celebrated shorebird, showing the obstacles rufared knots face, introducing a worldwide team of scientists and conservationists trying to save them, and offering insights about what we can do to help shorebirds before it's too late. Through prose, research, and images, Hoose explores the tragedy of extinction through the triumph of a single bird.","Farrar, Straus and Giroux (BYR)",160.0,2012.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12510885-moonbird,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1359803840m/12510885.jpg,Moonbird: A Year on the Wind with the Great Survivor B95,Phillip M.

1417,3190,eng,5.0,"For centuries, creative visualization has been used in meditation to focus the mind. In more recent times, it's been used to help people achieve their goals and enhance their performance. Building on these approaches, this book offers a series of unique exercises to help the reader access the deepest part of their imagination and bring their creative practice to a new level. To suggest that your internal resources and imagination comprise a gold mine is an understatement. Almost everyone has a wealth of untapped potential that can be accessed through creative visualization techniques and this book will help them do it. Research demonstrates that creativity is a natural part of the human condition and those who choose to engage with their creativity tend to experience greater levels of happiness and well-being. There's also substantial evidence demonstrating that creative individuals tend to perform better at work, and that organizations harnessing the creativity of their people tend to be more competitive in the global marketplace. That said, this book is written for the individual, for the person who wants the time and space to think these things through for themselves, to explore their own imagination and enhance their own creative practice in whatever form that may take. Part 1 of this book asks the reader a series of questions to help them understand their own thoughts about creativity and explore ways in which they can bring creative approaches to the work they do. It also offers the reader a broad introduction to the key concepts associated with creative visualization and meditation while drawing on the scientific research about creativity. The myth of the 'creative genius' is blown apart, and replaced with common sense explanations of how big ideas happen and how creative outcomes are achieved. Part 2 of this book offers 14 unique creative visualization exercises, ranging from quick and easy introductory exercises to longer and more complex exercises. It is recommended that the reader do one exercise every alternate day, as this will give them the opportunity to integrate what they've learnt from each exercise and decide how they're going to use it in their creative practice. Following this suggestion, it will take the reader about one month to work their way through the book. Part 3 of this book offers the reader some practical advice about moving forward and using what they've learned from the exercises to enhance their creative practice. It explains how they can integrate these key insights into their work, and make their inner critic work FOR them, not against them. It also offers advice about getting back into the flow of creativity after a rigorous session with their inner critic so they can produce work to the standard they aspire. There is also an extensive list of further and recommended reading, at the end of this book, should the reader wish to explore some of the exciting research findings available on the topics of creativity, meditation and creative visualization techniques.",CreateSpace,134.0,2016.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29257023-creative-visualization,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1456304175m/29257023.jpg,Creative Visualization: Access your Imagination and Enhance your Creative Practice (Inspiration & Creativity Series #2),Val  Andrews,9781530059478,[]

US intelligence, in anticipation of this threat, has constructed an interplanetary transport capable of travelling through time. The objective is to send the transport back to 1945 (post World War II America) and convince the Truman Administration of the need to destroy all remaining nuclear weapons; as well as any archived records related to their construction.
However, should the warning from the future not be enough to dissuade Truman and his administration from continued production of said weapons, the decision would be made for him through swift and decisive military action using weaponry unimagined in 1945.
As the project dubbed Armageddon seems to be moving along according to plan, a coup engineered by the racially biased head of the CIA takes the transport back to the US Civil war, and changes its outcome instead.
As we flash forward to 2026(post Armageddon) the coup proves to have been a success, as what was formally known as the USA has become the Confederate States of America. A unilaterally governed society split into two separate classes: Ruling and Sub. Slavery has been altered to a form of indentured servitude, with the former slaves making up the majority of the subclass.
With no true democratic process, comes zero hope for a civil rights movement. That is until some dissension arises amongst the ruling class. Persons previously on board with the coup align themselves with a subclass underground group of united rebels hell bent on undoing the gross injustice perpetrated upon humanity.

In the wake of his parents' deaths, his divorce from his wife of more than thirty years, and his retirement from the New York legal firm where he was a partner, he's felt an irresistible need to give away his possessions, alarming his children and perplexing the executor of his estate. With the last of his wealth, he travels to Israel, with a nebulous plan to do something to honor his parents. In Tel Aviv, he is sidetracked by a charismatic American rabbi planning a reunion for the descendants of King David who insists that Epstein is part of that storied dynastic line. He also meets the rabbi's beautiful daughter who convinces Epstein to become involved in her own project--a film about the life of David being shot in the desert--with life-changing consequences.
But Epstein isn't the only seeker embarking on a metaphysical journey that dissolves his sense of self, place, and history. Leaving her family in Brooklyn, a young, well-known novelist arrives at the Tel Aviv Hilton where she has stayed every year since birth.

The woman who aspires to raise children for the glory of God, to develop the ministry of the home, or to co-labor with her husband is deemed ""old-fashioned"" or ""unfulfilled."" The modern lure of independence and career has bewitched an entire generation to exchange the beauty of Christian womanhood for the temporary enticements of a society at war with the family.
Amidst this confusion, Kathleen Norris's Motheris a refreshing call to sanity. Motheris the fictional tale of a young lady who leaves home and repudiates family life in the hope of finding personal fulfillment through independence and a career. She decides that home life is a poor choice in the face of life in the big city. But God dramatically changes her heart as she realizes that wealth and position are illusory and that independence can enslave a young lady. She discovers that the greatest woman she has ever known is her mother and now she longs for home and motherhood.

Over the course of 4 Olympic Games and throughout her career as a world champion triathlete, Taormina refined her exceptional technique as a student of the sport, studying the world's best swimmers using underwater photographs and video analysis. From Johnny Weissmuller to Michael Phelps, the world's fastest swimmers share one common element: a high-elbow underwater pull.
Too many swimmers and triathletes neglect the pull, distracted by stroke count or perfecting details like body position or streamlining. Taormina uses simple science and crystal clear underwater photos of Olympic athletes to show how the high-elbow underwater pull is the most crucial technique for faster swimming.

Encouraging, inspiring, and practical, The Grace in Aginginvites all those who have ever experienced spiritual longing to awaken in their twilight years. Since aging, in and of itself, does not lead to spiritual maturity, The Grace in Agingsuggests and explores causes and conditions that we can create in our lives, just as we are living them, to allow awakening to unfold--transforming the predictable sufferings of aging into profound opportunities for growth in clarity, love, compassion, and peace.
Kathleen Dowling Singh streamlines vast and complex teachings into skillful means and wise views. Straightforward language and piercing questions bring Singh's teachings into the sharp focus of our own lives; the contemplative nature of each chapter allows for an uncommon depth of inquiry. Examples from our lives and from the chatter in our own minds touch the reader personally, offering the chance to absorb the implications deeply and do the work of freeing his or her own mind. Ecumenical in spirit, tone, and language, Singh offers wisdom from teachers from a variety of spiritual backgrounds: Chogyam Trungpa, the Apostles, Annie Dillard, and more. Lessening our attachments, decreasing our aversions, unbinding what binds us, we bear witness to the possibility of awakening for all beings.

He found his tribe in New York's East Village, a neighborhood noted in the 1970s and '80s for drugs, blight, and a burgeoning art scene. His creativity spilled out in paintings, photographs, films, texts, installations, and in his life and its recounting-creating a sort of mythos around himself. His circle of East Village artists moved into the national spotlight just as the AIDS plague began its devastating advance, and as right-wing culture warriors reared their heads. As Wojnarowicz's reputation as an artist grew, so did his reputation as an agitator-because he dealt so openly with his homosexuality, so angrily with his circumstances as a Person With AIDS, and so fiercely with his would-be censors.

1505,3372,eng,3.67,"Limited time offer: Through special arrangement with University Press of New England, we are pleased to offer a specially priced two-book set of Unbuttoning America and Peyton Place for just $29.95 paperback.
Published in 1956, Peyton Place became a bestseller and a literary phenomenon. A lurid and gripping story of murder, incest, female desire, and social injustice, it was consumed as avidly by readers as it was condemned by critics and the clergy. Its author, Grace Metalious, a housewife who grew up in poverty in a New Hampshire mill town and had aspired to be a writer from childhood, loosely based the novel's setting, characters, and incidents on real-life places, people, and events. The novel sold more than 30 million copies in hardcover and paperback, and it was adapted into a hit Hollywood film in 1957 and a popular television series that aired from 1964 to 1969. More than half a century later, the term ""Peyton Place"" is still in circulation as a code for a community harboring sordid secrets.
In Unbuttoning America, Ardis Cameron mines extensive interviews, fan letters, and archival materials including contemporary cartoons and cover images from film posters and foreign editions to tell how the story of a patricide in a small New England village circulated over time and became a cultural phenomenon. She argues that Peyton Place, with its frank discussions of poverty, sexuality, class and ethnic discrimination, and small-town hypocrisy, was more than a tawdry potboiler.

An Indian man writes to a Japanese woman. She writes back. They fall in love and exchange vows in their letters, then live as man and wife without ever setting eyes on each other - their intimacy of words finally tested by life's miraculous upheavals. The twelve stories in this collection are about the unexpected. An American professor visits India with the purpose of committing suicide, and goes on a desert journey with the daughter of a snake charmer. A honeymooning Indian couple is caught up in the Tienanmen Square unrest. A Russian prostitute discovers her roots in the company of Calcutta revolutionaries. A holocaust victim stands tall among strangers in a landscape of hate. These are chronicles of memories and dreams born at the crossroads of civilizations. They parade a cast of angels and demons rubbing shoulders with those whose lives are never quite as ordinary as they seem.
The Japanese Wife has now earned the added distinction of its title story being made into a film by the renowned director Aparna Sen. Narrated by the author over a casual conversation in Oxford, she found it ""an improbable and hauntingly beautiful love story, almost surreal in its innocence"". That, and ""the potential for great visuals"" was what impelled her to make the film, she said in a TV interview. For Basu, this film represents a further tryst in his long affair with cinema, ""the most magical of all the arts"".

The stranger claims to be the child of a lost Mughal princess, the youngest sister of Akbar's grandfather Babar: Qara Koz, 'Lady Black Eyes', a great beauty believed to possess powers of enchantment and sorcery, who is taken captive first by an Uzbek warlord, then by the Shah of Persia, and finally becomes the lover of a certain Argalia, a Florentine soldier of fortune, commander of the armies of the Ottoman Sultan. When Argalia returns home with his Mughal mistress the city is mesmerized by her presence, and much trouble ensues.
The Enchantress of Florenceis the story of a woman attempting to command her own destiny in a man's world. It brings together two cities that barely know each other - the hedonistic Mughal capital, in which the brilliant emperor wrestles daily with questions of belief, desire and the treachery of sons, and the equally sensual Florentine world of powerful courtesans, humanist philosophy and inhuman torture, where Argalia's boyhood friend ""il Machia"" - Niccolo Machiavelli - is learning, the hard way, about the true brutality of power. These two worlds, so far apart, turn out to be uncannily alike, and the enchantments of women hold sway over them both.

And her unease skyrockets when her sister subsequently vanishes. The police have no authority and little interest, so Anna decides to take matters into her own hands by infiltrating the group to discover for herself what happened to Liz, where she meets....
Dante, half demon, half human. A mix of two worlds, accepted by neither, he's had no choice but to learn the hard way how to play whatever side of the fence kept him alive during his nearly 500 years of existence. Now, as second-in-command of the Blood Ravagers biker gang, his survival depends on keeping his humanity a secret. Dante's ultimate goal is to fulfill the vows he made over two centuries ago to create a world where half-breeds can live in safety and equality.
But when sheltered schoolteacher Anna finds unexpected, white-hot passion in the arms of Dante, will her quest for the truth cost him more than he ever bargained for?

Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.""
Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, A Confederacy of Dunces. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. (""Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss."") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job.
Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through A Confederacy of Dunces are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. --Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

At sixteen, Mina's mother is dead, her magician father is vicious, and her silent heart has never beat with love for anyone--has never beat at all, in fact, but she'd always thought that fact normal. She never guessed that her father cut out her heart and replaced it with one of glass. When she moves to Whitespring Castle and sees its king for the first time, Mina forms a plan: win the king's heart with her beauty, become queen, and finally know love. The only catch is that she'll have to become a stepmother.
Fifteen-year-old Lynet looks just like her late mother, and one day she discovers why: a magician created her out of snow in the dead queen's image, at her father's order. But despite being the dead queen made flesh, Lynet would rather be like her fierce and regal stepmother, Mina. She gets her wish when her father makes Lynet queen of the southern territories, displacing Mina. Now Mina is starting to look at Lynet with something like hatred, and Lynet must decide what to do--and who to be--to win back the only mother she's ever known...or else defeat her once and for all.
Entwining the stories of both Lynet and Mina in the past and present, Girls Made of Snow and Glasstraces the relationship of two young women doomed to be rivals from the start.

Gygax's magnum opus, Dungeons & Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered.
Gygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating. But as Witwer shows, perhaps the most compelling facet of his life and work was his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity in the face of myriad sources of adversity, whether cultural, economic, or personal. Through his creation of the role-playing genre, Gygax gave two generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds.

JUST ONE NIGHT
Jason Hart has just one night to prove to his best friend's older sister that anything is possible . . .
Nicole de Salvo has been in love - and lust - for her little brother's best friend for years. For years she's watched from afar and done nothing about her attraction for Jason Hart only now their time together is almost at an end. On their last night together will she find the courage to do something about her feelings, or will she live with regret for the rest of her life?
ONE SPECIAL NIGHT
It's been nearly six months since Tommy de Salvo's fiancee cheated and left him in the midst of wedding preparations because up-and-coming businessman Tommy was all work and no play. The last thing Tommy wants or needs is to be attracted to another woman who won't be around for too long. A woman just like Navy Corpsman Jasmine Reyes. She's rough, tough, and determined to go it alone, but Tommy knows that if he passes up this opportunity, he may regret it more than the loss of his fiancee ...
Jasmine ""Doc"" Reyes is both emotionally and physically scarred after her tour of duty. Wounded in battle, all she can think about is rebuilding her life and continuing with the career that she's dreamed about since she was a young child. She has no time for rich sexy men who've never had a care in the world and wouldn't understand her determination. But Tommy's charm is seductive and she knows that she has to explore the attraction, even if it's only for this one special night.
ONE LAST NIGHT
It's been over a year since Marine Lieutenant Trevor Mason and his father have spoken. After nearly losing his life during a Taliban attack in Afghanistan, Trevor wants to end the rift between them so he can return to active duty with some peace of mind. But a visit to his father's office only serves to show Trevor that his father isn't as eager to reunite. If not for the intervention of Samuel Mason's spunky and very sexy intern, Trevor would probably be returning to Afghanistan with his one wish unfulfilled.
Trevor Mason had used to do all kinds of things to Maggie Sullivan's insides when she worked at the country club his family used to attend. Five years later, there is little left of the teen she knew in the stoic Marine who only wants some time with his father. When Trevor's father backs out of his son's dinner invitation at the last minute, Maggie does the only thing she can: she goes to Trevor's apartment to deliver the news, but she can't leave him alone on his one last night before returning to duty.
Thrown together, Trevor and Maggie can't ignore the sexual heat between them. As they satisfy one set of needs, another slowly develops as passion breathes life into other emotions.

1578,3527,eng,4.0,"In the tradition of Blade Runner and Brave New World comes a terrifying postmodern vision... Steven-Elliot Altman and Diane DeKelb-Rittenhouse ignite a powder-keg of scientific and religious controversy in THE KILLSWITCH REVIEW as they explore, and explode, the arguments over prolonged life through Stem Cell technology as it heralds America into a new class system offering forced sterility, birth restrictions, mass unemployment, and a final solution through government sanctioned, technology-assisted suicide. Along with DeKelb-Rittenhouse, Altman, best known for his War Of The Worlds style faux medical epidemic that he launched with his best-selling novel DEPRIVERS, and his critically acclaimed (all proceeds dedicated to AIDS and Cancer research) anthology THE TOUCH, has again touched every societal sore spot imaginable in this exploration of the not-to-distant future (where many of us are still alive, and no one looks a day over thirty), and showed no fear in taking on both sides of the heated scientific and religious debates that are clearly headed our way, and that most of us have yet to even consider... Imagine living forever or, if not forever, indefinitely always looking the age you want to, with all your vitality intact. Medical progress and technology have eliminated disease. The only reason to die is because you choose to (most frequently the result of boredom, loneliness or bankruptcy), and then there is a simple, efficient, legally mandated way to do it. The problem is that while the world s population has increased, its natural resources have diminished. Species once essential to human survival are now extinct. All food is cloned. The United States has closed its borders. For the rest of the planet, poverty and disease are everyday realities. To save itself, India has allowed its people to have computers implanted in their skulls that permanently connect them to cyberspace, to serve as fortunetellers for bored U.S. citizens entertainment. Sex with androids is acceptable. In the U.S., forced sterilization is a matter of law. Couples must apply for permission to have children. But only the right couples need apply, and those approved can bear only one child. Now imagine you are one of those children, growing up without brothers, sisters, aunts or uncles in a place where no one who has work will voluntarily leave it. Opportunities are nonexistent unless you choose to be mutated and participate in violent arena sports guaranteed to kill you if the mutation doesn t do it first. At least you ll die rich and famous. For the rest of Generation Zero (as the youth of America self-proclaim themselves) there is nothing but time. Time to wait. Time to despair. Time to lose yourself in oblivion. Imagine a place where an entire generation might just decide they re better off dead and a system that might agree. All it needs is a trigger. Welcome to NewVada. By the year 2156, stem cell therapy has triumphed over aging and disease, extending the human lifespan indefinitely. But only for those who have achieved Conscientious Citizen Status. To combat overpopulation, the U.S. has sealed her borders, instituted compulsory contraception, and made technology-assisted suicide readily available. Yet in a world where the old can remain vital forever, America's youth have little hope of prosperity. Jason Haggerty is an investigator for the government agency responsible for dispensing personal handheld devices that record a citizen's final moments. When three teens stage an illegal public suicide, Haggerty suspects their deaths may have been murders. Now he must uncover proof and prevent a nationwide epidemic of copycat suicides.

Living in charity with a distant uncle in New York, barely scraping by, Brady is unsure he will be able to uphold the promise, much less quell the loneliness, until an angel appears at the docks, Saran Reichardt.
Headstrong and tenacious, gentlewoman Saran knows she's unlike most women of society. Dedicated to teaching and helping the impoverished, she has no need of a man to take care of her, but an accidental encounter with a stormy-eyed Irish immigrant and his young son changes her perception of what need really is. Will this holiday give them both the hope and faith they desire or will their own stubbornness keep them apart?
Excerpt:
The port authorities on Ellis Island detained them for hours, first holding them on the ship, then in boarded stalls, shuffled like cattle through registration. Next, they were taken to a special area where their hair and teeth were checked for lice and other abnormalities. Through it all, Brady believed his beloved Mary had watched over them. Much to Brady's delight, authorities allowed them to retain the name of McCormick, as it was easy to spell. Yet, many were forced to alter their names for ease of registration.
He kept a firm grasp on Danny's hand as they rounded the corner of the great brick building. A bitter wind assaulted him and nearly snatched his hat from his head. He had no idea what day it was, or what time, except that it was night. Small frozen pellets grazed his cheeks, falling from the inky black sky. Tears stung Brady's eyes. ""Aye, your Ma would have loved this, Daniel. She'd have looked on it as a great adventure."" He clamped his arm around his son's neck and drew him to his side. ""This is what she wanted most for you, Daniel.""
""Is this what you wanted, too, Da?""
His son's bright blue eyes--the color of his mother's--looked up at him in child-like wonder. How could he tell him that what he wished for most wasn't possible?

--John Updike
Born in 1862 into an exclusive New York society 'against whose rigid mores she often rebelled' Edith Wharton bridged the literary worlds of two continents and two centuries in her rich and glamorous life. The House of Mirth(1905), her tenth book, is the story of young Lily Bart and her tragic sojourn among the upper class of turn-of-the- century New York, touching upon the insidious effects of social convention and the sexual and financial aggression to which free-spirited women were exposed. 'A frivolous society',Wharton wrote, 'can acquire dramatic significance only through what its frivolity destroys.'

The gruesome nature of their deaths caused panic and fear in the East End for months, and gave rise to the sobriquet that was to become shorthand for a serial killer -- Jack the Ripper. For over a hundred years the murders have remained among the world's greatest unsolved crimes, and a wealth of theories have been posited which have pointed the finger at royalty, a barber, a doctor, a woman and an artist. By applying her formidable range of forensic and technical skills, Patricia Cornwell presents us with the hard evidence that the perpetrator was the world-famous artist Walter Sickert. Using techniques unknown in the late-Victorian age, Cornwell exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters.

1617,3623,eng,3.25,"Roberto Vivo's War: A Crime Against Humanity is a condensation of the history of war and the evolution of humanity in its search for enduring and active world peace. Vivo makes the morally unquestionable and politically inconvenient point that in a world where between five and nine out of ten victims of war are civilians, every war is a crime against humanity.
Making use of his talent for summary, Vivo takes the reader on a whirlwind tour of the history of war and peace from the earliest cultures to the major conflicts and peace efforts of today. He compares advances made in de-legitimizing and outlawing once accepted practices like torture, slavery and racism to the need to end war by criminalizing its use and by rendering even top world leaders accountable before the International Criminal Court for initiating aggressive conflicts against other nations.
The author's visits to the past--the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Mongol invasions, the Crusades and the worst wars and slaughters of contemporary history from the Jewish Holocaust to Vietnam, Cambodia and Ruanda--are juxtaposed to a parade of experiments in peace that have met with full or at least some degree of success throughout history. His analysis of the present is insightful and outspokenly critical of the politics and industry of war that have for so long ruled the world and rendered all First World-led ""peace efforts"" ostensibly futile and hypocritically proposed. His view of the future is conditional on peace, positing that unless humanity eschews war and engages in universal peace and cooperation, it will soon be too late to save humankind from self-extinction.
This book is divided into four exceedingly well-researched and documented chapters, covering the following topics:
Chapter 1, Violence and Man, begins with an anthropological analysis of a basic question that must be asked before any logical discussion of war and peace can be initiated: Is Man naturally prone toward organized mass violence, or is violence merely the consequence of certain forms of social organization? It discusses the devastating effects of wars over the course of human history and includes a summary of some of the most significant conflicts the world has known. It also explains the age-old ""just war theory"" and why it has lost all validity.
Chapter 2, The History of Peace, comes in sharp contrast to the preceding chapter, by providing examples of peaceful and prosperous coexistence dating back at least 4,000 years to the times of the Minoan culture in Crete. Since that time, a variety of examples from parts of the world far distant from one another have demonstrated time and again how communities have been able to live in a climate of dialogue, understanding and general concord. This chapter also demonstrates how, over the course of the past century, organizations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations, even despite certain major defects in their implementation, have served in the materialization of broad-ranging peace initiatives.
Chapter 3, Open Society and Closed Society, describes the contrasts between liberals and conservatives and between moderates and radicals, tending to illustrate the internal tension that this has fostered in societies, practically since politics first began. It further looks at how religious fundamentalism has reemerged over the course of the past decade, and concludes with reflections regarding secularism, proposing it as an opportunity to rethink the social implications of religious beliefs within the context of lasting peace.
Chapter 4 is the title chapter of this book, War: A Crime against Humanity. It makes a sound case for the ""de-legitimization"" and criminalization of war, and concludes with a study of international organizations such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court and NATO, among others, and their importance in the establishment of a genuine and enduring spirit of ""giving peace a chance.""",Hojas Del Sur,335.0,2015.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30843279-war,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,War: A Crime Against Humanity,Roberto Vivo,9789671882542,[]

1626,3644,eng,4.19,"Poetry. Finalist, Acorn-Plantos Award. Winner, Exit Through the Giftshop Award (2013). Best Poetry of 2012 selection, Winnipeg Free Press. Each new volume by Stuart Ross is a more confounding grab bag than the last. In YOU EXIST. DETAILS FOLLOW., his seventh full- length collection of poetry, Stuart Ross veers in opposite directions: narrative confessionalism poems, and works that might be considered abstract expressionist, and a lot both in between and beyond those boundaries. Still, each poem breathes with the signature weirdness, the sharp wit and gentle awe that Ross is known for. Here you'll find poems from Ross's ongoing auto-biographical Razovsky series, one-line poems, centos, fractured sonnets, poems composed through surrealist strategies, and more.
""Ross's absurdism doesn't rely on unconnected sentences, abstract thought, or an unusual, elevated vocabulary: rather, his poetry delights in the silliness of concrete mundanity. The collection thus begins by launching us into a happily disjointed mind, into images connected as though by sparking, duct-taped wires, buzzing weird electrical fires of thought."" Matrix Magazine
""A voice all his own. Stuart Ross unleashes his refreshing snark in his latest collection of poems He runs the gamut from his own brand of absurdist expressionism to fond childhood memories and poetic confessions. Ross wisely and parenthetically writes: (Tension is a good thing sometimes. For example, you should stick it in art.) Stuart Ross loves that tension, fortunately for his readers."" Uptown
""I personally believe Stuart Ross may be Canada's most important poet Ross could be called a 'narrative surrealist' but that, like most labels, does not adequately capture the gymnastic feats of construction he employs. At his best Ross combines images and emotions with the same alacrity of a Max Ernst or Salvador Dali. The literal is a sheer curtain that surrealists drape like a fabric or a fold in time. Ross gives a master class in almost every poem in the delicate art of balancing truth from fiction, what we imagine from what we know to be real For me, there is no poet as entertaining as Stuart Ross and very few as smart. Ross builds a new universe with You Exist. Details Follow. and we get to travel in it like explorers entering a new dimension, luckily it comes with instructions and a guide map for home.

Reluctant bank robber Jack Burn is on the run after a heist in the United States that left $3 million missing and one cop dead. Hiding out in Cape Town, South Africa, he is desperate to build a new life for his pregnant wife and young son.

In this provocative book, Fred Dretske argues that to achieve an understanding of the mind it is not enough to understand the biological machinery by means of which the mind does its job. One must understand what the mind's job is and how this task can be performed by a physical system -- the nervous system.
Naturalizing the Mindskillfully develops a representational theory of the qualitative, the phenomenal, the what-it-is-like aspects of the mind that have defied traditional forms of naturalism. Central to Dretske's approach is the claim that the phenomenal aspects of perceptual experiences are one and the same as external, real-world properties that experience represents objects as having. Combined with an evolutionary account of sensory representation, the result is a completely naturalistic account of phenomenal consciousness.",Bradford Book,208.0,1997.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/817461.Naturalizing_the_Mind,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,Naturalizing the Mind,Fred I.
