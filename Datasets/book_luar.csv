The Grapes of Wrath,John Steinbeck,,"Oklahoma (United States), California (United States), The United States of America, Route 66 (United States)","The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers.  First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.","Classics, Fiction, Historical Fiction, Literature, Novels, School, American","479 pages, Hardcover","April 10, 2014 by Viking",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375670575i/18114322.jpg,"Tom Joad, Rose of Sharon Joad Rivers, Ma Joad, Pa Joad, Uncle John Joad, Jim Casy, Al Joad, Ruthie Joad, Winfield Joad, Noah Joad, Grampa Joad, Granma Joad, Connie Rivers",9780670016907 (ISBN10: 067001690X),English

Brave New World,Aldous Huxley,,"New Mexico (United States), London, England (, 2540)","Aldous Huxley's profoundly important classic of world literature, Brave New World is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order–all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls. “A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. Brave New World, his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature.

Slaughterhouse-Five,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Critical Insights,"Dresden (Germany, 1945), Tralfamadore, Ilium (United States), Germany, The United States of America","Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.”  An instant bestseller, made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.","Fiction, Science Fiction, Classics, Historical Fiction, War, Literature, Novels","275 pages, Paperback","January 12, 1999 by Dial Press",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440319389i/4981.jpg,"Billy Pilgrim, Kilgore Trout, Eliot Rosewater, Roland Weary, Paul Lazzaro, Edgar Derby, Robert Pilgrim, Valencia Merble, Barbara Pilgrim, Howard W.

East of Eden,John Steinbeck,,"California (United States), Salinas Valley, California (United States), The United States of America","In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden “the first book,” and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.  Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him, the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.  First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.","Fiction, Classics, Historical Fiction, Literature, Novels, American, Literary Fiction","601 pages, Paperback","January 1, 2002 by Penguin Books",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1639969375i/4406.jpg,"Lee, Tom Hamilton, Cyrus Trask, Adam Trask, Charles Trask, Aron Trask, Caleb Trask, Samuel Hamilton, Liza Hamilton, Will Hamilton, Dessie Hamilton, Olive Hamilton, Cathy Ames, Abra Bacon, Joe Valery",9780142000656 (ISBN10: 0142000655),English

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins.

The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.","Science Fiction, Fiction, Young Adult, Fantasy, Classics, Science Fiction Fantasy, Dystopia","324 pages, Mass Market Paperback","September 30, 2004 by Tor",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130i/375802.jpg,"Dink, Bernard, Valentine Wiggin, Peter Wiggin, Mazer Rackham, Alai, Hyrum Graff, Andrew Wiggin, Petra Arkanian, ""Bean"", Major Anderson, Bonzo, Major Imbu",9780812550702 (ISBN10: 0812550706),English

The Pillars of the Earth,Ken Follett,Kingsbridge (#1),England,"Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.  Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century, the place feudal England, and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape.  Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder, Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman, Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge, Jack, the artist in stone, and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.  The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.","Historical Fiction, Fiction, Historical, Fantasy, Classics, Medieval, Audiobook","976 pages, Paperback","February 4, 2002 by NAL Trade",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100i/5043.jpg,"Thomas Becket, Henry II of England, Tom Builder, Prior Philip, Aliena, Jack Jackson, Stephen of England, Empress Matilda, William Hamleigh, Ellen, Richard of Kingsbridge, Alfred Builder, Waleran Bigod, Lord Percy Hamleigh, Lady Regan Hamleigh, Remigius",,English

One hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka. The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan. But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate, the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him.

It was first serialized in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called """"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement.""""  According to Declan Kiberd, """"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking"""". chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain.  The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature. Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 to protracted textual """"Joyce Wars."""" The novel's stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose—replete with puns, parodies, and allusions—as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history, Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.'","Fiction, Literature, Classics, Novels, Ireland, Irish Literature, 20th Century","925 pages, Paperback","January 1, 1990 by Vintage",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428891345i/338798.jpg,"Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, Marion ""Molly"" Bloom, Malachi ""Buck"" Mulligan, Mr. Garret Deasy, Bantam Lyons, Simon Dedalus, Myles Crawford, William Humble, Earl of Dudley, Hugh ""Blazes"" Boylan, The Citizen, Gerty MacDowell, Mina Purefoy, John Corley, D.B.

A Confederacy of Dunces,John Kennedy Toole,,"New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)","Here is Ignatius Reilly: slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one, who is in violent revolt against the entire modern age, lying in his flannel nightshirt in a back bedroom on Constantinople Street in New Orleans, who between gigantic seizures of flatulence and eructations is filling dozens of Big Chief tablets with invective.  His mother thinks he needs to go to work. He does, in a succession of jobs. Each job rapidly escalates into a lunatic adventure, a full-blown disaster, yet each has, like Don Quixote's, its own eerie logic.  His girlfriend, Myrna Minkoff of the Bronx, thinks he needs sex.  Ignatius is an intellectual, ideologue, deadbeat, goof-off, glutton, who should repel the reader with his gargantuan bloats, his thunderous contempt, and one-man war against everybody: Freud, homosexuals, heterosexuals, Protestants, and the assorted excesses of modern times.

Angela’s Ashes,Frank McCourt,Frank McCourt (#1),"Limerick (Ireland), New York (State) (United States), Ireland","Imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.  """"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.""""  So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies.  Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.  Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.","Nonfiction, Memoir, Biography, Classics, Ireland, Autobiography, Biography Memoir","452 pages, Paperback","October 3, 2005 by Harper Perennial",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348317139i/252577.jpg,Frank McCourt,9780007205233 (ISBN10: 0007205236),English

Four mothers, four daughters, four families, whose histories shift with the four winds depending on who's telling the stories. In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet weekly to play mahjong and tell stories of what they left behind in China. United in loss and new hope for their daughters' futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers' advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives – until their own inner crises reveal how much they've unknowingly inherited of their mothers' pasts.  With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.","Fiction, Historical Fiction, Classics, China, Contemporary, Historical, Adult Fiction","352 pages, Paperback","September 21, 2006 by Penguin Books",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1304978653i/7763.jpg,"Suyuan Woo, June Woo, Lindo Jong, Waverly Jong, An-Mei Hsu, Rose Hsu Jordan, Ying-Ying St. Clair, Lena St. Clair",,English

And the worst part is, if you go bohemian or something crazy like that, you’re conforming just as much only in a different way.’  First published in The New Yorker as two sequential stories, ‘Franny’ and ‘Zooey’ offer a dual portrait of the two youngest members of J. D. Salinger’s fictional Glass family.  Franny Glass is a pretty, effervescent college student on a date with her intellectually confident boyfriend, Lane. They appear to be the perfect couple, but as they struggle to communicate with each other about the things they really care about, slowly their true feelings come to the surface.

A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,James Joyce,,,"The portrayal of Stephen Dedalus's Dublin childhood and youth, his quest for identity through art and his gradual emancipation from the claims of family, religion and Ireland itself, is also an oblique self-portrait of the young James Joyce and a universal testament to the artist's 'eternal imagination'.

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found.

Nine little boys sat up very late, One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon, One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks, One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive, A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law, One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea, A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo, A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun, One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone, He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""""  When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale?

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions, and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.  Written in 1953, is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's """"witch-hunts"""" in the United States.

Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.  For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.  Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.

The Plague,Albert Camus,,"Oran (Algeria), Algeria, North Africa","The Plague is a novel by Albert Camus, published in 1947.  It tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.  The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.  The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings, the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.","Fiction, Classics, Philosophy, France, Literature, French Literature, Novels","308 pages, Paperback","March 1, 1991 by Vintage International",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503362434i/11989.jpg,"Raoul, Dr Bernard Rieux, Father Paneloux, Joseph Grand, Raymond Rambert, Jean Tarrou, Cottard, M.

The Thorn Birds,Colleen McCullough,,"Australia, Vatican City (Italy), New Zealand, Outback (Australia)","The Thorn Birds is a robust, romantic saga of a singular family, the Clearys. It begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister, and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.  The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph's course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican, and Meggie's except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.  Wonderful characters people this book, strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory, dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women, Meggie, Ralph, and Meggie's children, Justine and Dane.

Roots: The Saga of an American Family,Alex Haley,,,"When he was a boy in Henning, Tennessee, Alex Haley's grandmother used to tell him stories about their family—stories that went back to her grandparents, and their grandparents, down through the generations all the way to a man she called """"the African."""" She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the """"Kamby Bolongo"""" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.  Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of """"the African""""—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.  Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him—slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects—and one author.  But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. But speaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.","Historical Fiction, Fiction, Classics, Historical, African American, Africa, Race","888 pages, Mass Market Paperback","First published August 17, 1976",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329398936i/546018.jpg,,,

Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt interweaves a first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.  The story is peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club, the turbulent young redneck gigolo, the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah, the aging and profane Southern belle who is the """"soul of pampered self-absorption"""", the uproarious black drag queen, the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer, the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist, young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball, and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.","Nonfiction, True Crime, Mystery, Crime, History, Classics, Audiobook","386 pages, Paperback","June 28, 1999 by Vintage",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427166915i/386187.jpg,"Jim Williams, Danny Hansford, Lucille Wright, Mary Harty, Joe Odom, Mandy Nichols, William Simon Glover, Luther Driggers, Serena Vaughn Dawes, Johnny Mercer, Emma Kelly, Chablis, Lee Adler, Conrad Aiken, Spencer Lawton Jr., Minerva, Sonny Seiler",9780679751526 (ISBN10: 0679751521),English

A Room of One’s Own,Virginia Woolf,,,"A Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf. First published on the 24th of October, 1929, the essay was based on a series of lectures she delivered at Newnham College and Girton College, two women's colleges at Cambridge University in October 1928. While this extended essay in fact employs a fictional narrator and narrative to explore women both as writers and characters in fiction, the manuscript for the delivery of the series of lectures, titled Women and Fiction, and hence the essay, are considered nonfiction. The essay is seen as a feminist text, and is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.","Classics, Nonfiction, Feminism, Essays, Philosophy, Writing, Literature","112 pages, Paperback","January 1, 2000 by Penguin Books",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327883012i/18521.jpg,,,English

A People’s History of the United States,Howard Zinn,,,"In the book, Zinn presented a different side of history from the more traditional """"fundamental nationalist glorification of country"""". Zinn portrays a side of American history that can largely be seen as the exploitation and manipulation of the majority by rigged systems that hugely favor a small aggregate of elite rulers from across the orthodox political parties. A People's History has been assigned as reading in many high schools and colleges across the United States. It has also resulted in a change in the focus of historical work, which now includes stories that previously were ignored  Library Journal calls Howard Zinn’s book “a brilliant and moving history of the American people from the point of view of those…whose plight has been largely omitted from most histories.”","History, Nonfiction, Politics, American History, Historical, Social Justice, Classics","729 pages, Paperback","First published January 1, 1980",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1494279423i/2767.jpg,,,

On a cold March night New York Times reporter John Schuyler Moore is summoned to the East River by his friend and former Harvard classmate Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a psychologist, or """"alienist."""" On the unfinished Williamsburg Bridge, they view the horribly mutilated body of an adolescent boy, a prostitute from one of Manhattan's infamous brothels.  The newly appointed police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt, in a highly unorthodox move, enlists the two men in the murder investigation, counting on the reserved Kreizler's intellect and Moore's knowledge of New York's vast criminal underworld. They are joined by Sara Howard, a brave and determined woman who works as a secretary in the police department. Laboring in secret (for alienists, and the emerging discipline of psychology, are viewed by the public with skepticism at best), the unlikely team embarks on what is a revolutionary effort in criminology-- amassing a psychological profile of the man they're looking for based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who has killed before--and will kill again before the hunt is over.  Fast-paced and gripping, infused with a historian's exactitude, The Alienist conjures up the Gilded Age and its untarnished underside: verminous tenements and opulent mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills. Here is a New York during an age when questioning society's belief that all killers are born, not made, could have unexpected and mortal consequences.","Historical Fiction, Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Crime, Historical, Mystery Thriller","498 pages, Paperback","October 24, 2006 by Random House",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388256626i/40024.jpg,"Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, John Schuyler Moore, Theodore Roosevelt",9780812976144 (ISBN10: 0812976142),English

Alan Paton’s impassioned novel about a black man’s country under white man’s law is a work of searing beauty.  Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or valley. For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.

The Witching Hour,Anne Rice,Lives of the Mayfair Witches (#1),"New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), Louisiana, United States (United States), Scotland Yard, London, England","From the author of the extraordinary Vampire Chronicles comes a huge, hypnotic novel of witchcraft and the occult through four centuries.  Demonstrating, once again, her gift for spellbinding storytelling and the creation of legend, Anne Rice makes real for us a great dynasty of witches—a family given to poetry and to incest, to murder and to philosophy, a family that, over the ages, is itself haunted by a powerful, dangerous, and seductive being.  On the veranda of a great New Orleans house, now faded, a mute and fragile woman sits rocking... and begins.  It begins in our time with a rescue at sea.  Rowan Mayfair, a beautiful woman, a brilliant practitioner of neurosurgery—aware that she has special powers but unaware that she comes from an ancient line of witches—finds the drowned body of a man off the coast of California and brings him to life.  He is Michael Curry, who was born in New Orleans and orphaned in childhood by fire on Christmas Eve, who pulled himself up from poverty, and who now, in his brief interval of death, has acquired a sensory power that mystifies and frightens him.  As these two, fiercely drawn to each other, fall in love and—in passionate alliance—set out to solve the mystery of past and unwelcome gift, the novel moves backward and forward in time from today's New Orleans and San Francisco to long-ago Amsterdam and a château in the France of Louis XIV.  An intricate tale of evil unfolds—an evil unleashed in seventeenth-century Scotland, where the first """"witch,"""" Suzanne of the Mayfair, conjures up the spirit she names Lasher... a creation that spells her own destruction and torments each of her descendants in turn.  From the coffee plantations of Port au Prince, where the great Mayfair fortune is made and the legacy of their dark power is almost destroyed, to Civil War New Orleans, as Julien—the clan's only male to be endowed with occult powers—provides for the dynasty its foothold in America, the dark, luminous story encompasses dramas of seduction and death, episodes of tenderness and healing.  And always—through peril and escape, tension and release—there swirl around us the echoes of eternal war: innocence versus the corruption of the spirit, sanity against madness, life against death.  With a dreamlike power, the novel draws us, through circuitous, twilight paths, to the present and Rowan's increasingly inspired and risky moves in the merciless game that binds her to her heritage. And in New Orleans, on Christmas Eve, this strangest of family sagas is brought to its startling climax.","Horror, Fantasy, Fiction, Paranormal, Witches, Supernatural, Gothic","1207 pages, Paperback","November 4, 2004 by Arrow",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327289387i/11901.jpg,"Rowan Mayfair, Michael James Timothy Curry, Aaron Lightner, Lasher, Deirdre Mayfair, Stella Mayfair, Mary Beth Mayfair, Antha Mayfair, Carlotta Mayfair, Ellie Mayfair, Julien Mayfair, Marie Claudette Mayfair Landry, Angélique Mayfair, Katherine Mayfair, Remy Mayfair, Graham Franklin, Lionel Mayfair, Belle Mayfair, Darcy Monahan, Sean Lacy, Petyr van Abel, Deborah Mayfair de Montcleve, Suzanne Mayfair, Lestan Mayfair, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether.

The Phantom of the Opera,Gaston Leroux,,"Paris (France), Bretagne (France), France","First published in French as a serial in 1909, The Phantom of the Opera is a riveting story that revolves around the young, Swedish Christine Daaé. Her father, a famous musician, dies, and she is raised in the Paris Opera House with his dying promise of a protective angel of music to guide her. After a time at the opera house, she begins hearing a voice, who eventually teaches her how to sing beautifully. All goes well until Christine's childhood friend Raoul comes to visit his parents, who are patrons of the opera, and he sees Christine when she begins successfully singing on the stage. The voice, who is the deformed, murderous 'ghost' of the opera house named Erik, however, grows violent in his terrible jealousy, until Christine suddenly disappears. The phantom is in love, but it can only spell disaster.

For decades, Herriot roamed the remote, beautiful Yorkshire Dales, treating every patient that came his way from smallest to largest, and observing animals and humans alike with his keen, loving eye.  In All Creatures Great and Small, we meet the young Herriot as he takes up his calling and discovers that the realities of veterinary practice in rural Yorkshire are very different from the sterile setting of veterinary school. Some visits are heart-wrenchingly difficult, such as one to an old man in the village whose very ill dog is his only friend and companion, some are lighthearted and fun, such as Herriot's periodic visits to the overfed and pampered Pekinese Tricki Woo who throws parties and has his own stationery, and yet others are inspirational and enlightening, such as Herriot's recollections of poor farmers who will scrape their meager earnings together to be able to get proper care for their working animals. From seeing to his patients in the depths of winter on the remotest homesteads to dealing with uncooperative owners and critically ill animals, Herriot discovers the wondrous variety and never-ending challenges of veterinary practice as his humor, compassion, and love of the animal world shine forth.

Daß dieses im Herbst 1917 vollendete Buch erst im Juni 1919, ein halbes Jahr nach Kriegsende, veröffentlicht wurde, lag an der Unbekanntheit des Verfassers. Denn Hesse hatte das Manuskript dem Verlag als das Erstlingswerk eines kranken jungen Dichters empfohlen, des zeitkritischen Poeten Emil Sinclair, der bisher nur in Zeitungen und Zeitschriften durch pazifistische Mahnrufe und Erzählungen aufgefallen war (die gleichfalls von Hesse stammten). Doch trotz des Inkognitos erlebte das Buch eine geradezu stürmische Aufnahme und wurde noch im Erscheinungsjahr mit dem Fontane-Preis für das beste Erstlingswerk eines Nachwuchsautors ausgezeichnet. Thomas Mann verglich die elektrisierende Wirkung des Buches mit der von Goethes Werther, da es »mit unheimlicher Genauigkeit den Nerv der Zeit traf und eine ganze Jugend, die wähnte aus ihrer Mitte sei ihr ein Künder ihres tiefsten Lebens entstanden, zu dankbarem Entzücken hinriß«.

She is caught off-guard by a young hunter who invades her most private spaces and confounds her self-assured, solitary life.

And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected.

Roth's protagonist is Seymour 'Swede' Levov—a legendary high school athlete, a devoted family man, a hard worker, the prosperous inheritor of his father's Newark glove factory—comes of age in thriving, triumphant post-war America. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.  For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager—a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism.

Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster,Jon Krakauer,,,"When Jon Krakauer reached the summit of Mt. Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated.  is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment for Magazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996.  Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.","Nonfiction, Adventure, Memoir, Travel, Biography, History, Survival","368 pages, Paperback","First published May 1, 1997",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631501298i/1898.jpg,,,

Michener brings Hawaii’s epic history vividly to life in a classic saga that has captivated readers since its initial publication in 1959. As the volcanic Hawaiian Islands sprout from the ocean floor, the land remains untouched for centuries—until, little more than a thousand years ago, Polynesian seafarers make the perilous journey across the Pacific, flourishing in this tropical paradise according to their ancient traditions. Then, in the early nineteenth century, American missionaries arrive, bringing with them a new creed and a new way of life.

Looking back not only at his own much younger self, but also at the other writers who shared Paris with him - James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald - he recalls the time when, poor, happy, and writing in cafes, he discovered his vocation.

Corelli’s Mandolin,Louis de Bernières,,"Kefalonia (Greece), Greece","Captain Corelli’s Mandolin is set in the early days of the second world war, before Benito Mussolini invaded Greece. Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade, life isn’t so bad—at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of “Heil Hitler” with his own “Heil Puccini”, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches.  British author Louis de Bernières is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts, Señor Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island—the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins—would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Bernières seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. Captain Corelli’s Mandolin works on many levels, as a love story, a war story and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books.","Fiction, Historical Fiction, Romance, Classics, War, Greece, Historical","437 pages, Paperback","August 29, 1995 by Vintage",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479680795i/3388.jpg,"Pelagia, Antonio Corelli, Mandras, Dr Iannis",9780679763970 (ISBN10: 067976397X),English

Ella Enchanted,Gail Carson Levine,Ella Enchanted (#1),,"At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the """"gift"""" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: """"Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."""" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way.

The Illustrated Man,Ray Bradbury,,,"That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as """"The Veldt,"""" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or """"Kaleidoscope,"""" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or """"Zero Hour,"""" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now.

Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history.

The Souls of Black Folk,W.E.B. Du Bois,,,"This landmark book is a founding work in the literature of black protest. W. E. B. Du Bois (1868–1963) played a key role in developing the strategy and program that dominated early 20th-century black protest in America. In this collection of essays, first published together in 1903, he eloquently affirms that it is beneath the dignity of a human being to beg for those rights that belong inherently to all mankind. He also charges that the strategy of accommodation to white supremacy advanced by Booker T. Washington, then the most influential black leader in America, would only serve to perpetuate black oppression. Publication of The Souls of Black Folk was a dramatic event that helped to polarize black leaders into two groups: the more conservative followers of Washington and the more radical supporters of aggressive protest. Its influence cannot be overstated. It is essential reading for everyone interested in African-American history and the struggle for civil rights in America.","Nonfiction, History, Classics, Race, Essays, Sociology, Philosophy","288 pages, Paperback","September 26, 1996 by Penguin Classics",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309202855i/318742.jpg,,,English
The Complete Maus,Art Spiegelman,Maus (#1-2),"Auschwitz (Poland), Poland, Sosnowiec (Poland)","On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of its first publication, here is the definitive edition of the book acclaimed as “the most affecting and successful narrative ever done about the Holocaust” (Wall Street Journal) and “the first masterpiece in comic book history” (The New Yorker).  The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler’s Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father’s story. Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in “drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust” (The New York Times).  Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek’s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century’s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.","Graphic Novels, Comics, Nonfiction, History, Biography, Memoir, Historical","296 pages, Paperback","October 2, 2003 by Penguin Books",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327354180i/15195.jpg,"Vladek Spiegelman, Anja Spiegelman, Art Spiegelman, Mala Spiegelman",9780141014081 (ISBN10: 0141014083),English

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,Stephen R. Covey,,,"When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction, and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.  But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?  There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.  The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.  That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.  But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life","Self Help, Nonfiction, Business, Personal Development, Psychology, Leadership, Productivity","372 pages, Paperback","First published January 1, 1989",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421842784i/36072.jpg,,,

Fifth Business,Robertson Davies,The Deptford Trilogy (#1),,"Ramsay is a man twice born, a man who has returned from the hell of the battle-grave at Passchendaele in World War I decorated with the Victoria Cross and destined to be caught in a no man's land where memory, history, and myth collide. As Ramsay tells his story, it begins to seem that from boyhood, he has exerted a perhaps mystical, perhaps pernicious, influence on those around him. His apparently innocent involvement in such innocuous events as the throwing of a snowball or the teaching of card tricks to a small boy in the end prove neither innocent nor innocuous. Fifth Business stands alone as a remarkable story told by a rational man who discovers that the marvelous is only another aspect of the real.","Fiction, Canada, Classics, Historical Fiction, Literature, Literary Fiction, Novels","252 pages, Paperback","January 1, 2002 by Penguin",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170852646i/74406.jpg,"Dunstan Ramsay, Boy Staunton",9780141181363 (ISBN10: 0141181362),English

The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark,Carl Sagan,,,"How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don’t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.  Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.","Science, Nonfiction, Philosophy, Religion, History, Skepticism, Atheism","459 pages, Paperback","First published February 1, 1996",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553691804i/17349.jpg,,,
Letters to a Young Poet,Rainer Maria Rilke,,,"In 1903, a student at a military academy sent some of his verses to a well-known Austrian poet, requesting an assessment of their value. The older artist, Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926), replied to the novice in this series of letters—an amazing archive of remarkable insights into the ideas behind Rilke's greatest poetry. The ten letters reproduced here were written during an important stage in Rilke's artistic development, and they contain many of the themes that later appeared in his best works. The poet himself afterwards stated that his letters contained part of his creative genius, making this volume essential reading for scholars, poetry lovers, and anyone with an interest in Rilke, German poetry, or the creative impulse.","Poetry, Classics, Nonfiction, Philosophy, Writing, Essays, German Literature","80 pages, Paperback","May 8, 2002 by Dover Publications",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1321994947i/46199.jpg,,9780486422459 (ISBN10: 0486422453),English
Underworld,Don DeLillo,,"New Jersey (United States), Nevada (United States)","While Eisenstein documented the forces of totalitarianism and Stalinism upon the faces of the Russian peoples, DeLillo offers a stunning, at times overwhelming, document of the twin forces of the Cold War and American culture, compelling that """"swerve from evenness"""" in which he finds events and people both wondrous and horrifying.  Underworld opens with a breathlessly graceful prologue set during the final game of the Giants-Dodgers pennant race in 1951. Written in what DeLillo calls """"super-omniscience"""" the sentences sweep from young Cotter Martin as he jumps the gate to the press box, soars over the radio waves, runs out to the diamond, slides in on a fast ball, pops into the stands where J. Edgar Hoover is sitting with a drunken Jackie Gleason and a splenetic Frank Sinatra, and learns of the Soviet Union's second detonation of a nuclear bomb. It's an absolutely thrilling literary moment. When Bobby Thomson hits Branca's pitch into the outstretched hand of Cotter—the """"shot heard around the world""""—and Jackie Gleason pukes on Sinatra's shoes, the events of the next few decades are set in motion, all threaded together by the baseball as it passes from hand to hand.  """"It's all falling indelibly into the past,"""" writes DeLillo, a past that he carefully recalls and reconstructs with acute grace. Jump from Giants Stadium to the Nevada desert in 1992, where Nick Shay, who now owns the baseball, reunites with the artist Kara Sax. They had been brief and unlikely lovers 40 years before, and it is largely through the events, spinoffs, and coincidental encounters of their pasts that DeLillo filters the Cold War experience. He believes that """"global events may alter how we live in the smallest ways,"""" and as the book steps back in time to 1951, over the following 800-odd pages, we see just how those events alter lives. This reverse narrative allows the author to strip away the detritus of history and pop culture until we get to the story's pure elements: the bomb, the baseball, and the Bronx. In an epilogue as breathless and stunning as the prologue, DeLillo fast-forwards to a near future in which ruthless capitalism, the Internet, and a new, hushed faith have replaced the Cold War's blend of dread and euphoria.  Through fragments and interlaced stories—including those of highway killers, artists, celebrities, conspiracists, gangsters, nuns, and sundry others—DeLillo creates a fragile web of connected experience, a communal Zeitgeist that encompasses the messy whole of five decades of American life, wonderfully distilled.","Fiction, Novels, Literature, Literary Fiction, American, Classics, Historical Fiction","827 pages, Paperback","January 1, 1999 by Picador",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334304280i/11761.jpg,"Brian Glassic, Nick Shay, Klara Sax, Mario Badalato, Lenny Bruce, George Manza, Cotter Martin",9780330369954 (ISBN10: 0330369954),English

Civilization and Its Discontents,Sigmund Freud,,,"It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind—the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.  Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.   Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.   Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: under the general editorship of James Strachey.   Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself, the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.","Psychology, Philosophy, Nonfiction, Classics, Psychoanalysis, Sociology, Theory","127 pages, Paperback","First published January 1, 1930",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438544596i/357636.jpg,,,
Kim,Rudyard Kipling,,India,"Set after the Second Afghan War which ended in 1881, but before the Third fought in 1919, probably in the period 1893 to 1898. The novel is notable for its detailed portrait of the people, culture, and varied religions of India. The book presents a vivid picture of India, its teeming populations, religions, and superstitions, and the life of the bazaars and the road.  Two men - a boy who grows into early manhood and an old ascetic priest, the lama - are at the center of the novel. A quest faces them both. Born in India, Kim is nevertheless white, a sahib. While he wants to play the Great Game of Imperialism, he is also spiritually bound to the lama. His aim, as he moves chameleon-like through the two cultures, is to reconcile these opposing strands, while the lama searches for redemption from the Wheel of Life.  A celebration of their friendship in a beautiful but often hostile environment, 'Kim' captures the opulence of India's exotic landscape, overlaid by the uneasy presence of the British Raj.","Classics, Fiction, India, Historical Fiction, Adventure, Literature, Novels","366 pages, Mass Market Paperback","January 1, 1981 by Penguin Classics",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630963799i/210834.jpg,"Kimball O'Hara (Kim), Teshoo Lama",9780140183528 (ISBN10: 0140183523),English

The Executioner's Song,Norman Mailer,,Utah (United States),"In what is arguably his greatest work, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then killing them in cold blood, and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death. Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of American loneliness and violence.

Cryptonomicon,Neal Stephenson,,"Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, England, Southeast Asia, The Philippines","Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods—World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. """"When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""""  All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.","Fiction, Science Fiction, Historical Fiction, Cyberpunk, Thriller, Historical, War","1152 pages, Mass Market Paperback","November 5, 2002 by Avon",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327931476i/816.jpg,"Douglas MacArthur, Enoch Root, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, Robert Shaftoe, Earl Comstock, Rudolf von Hacklheber, Alan Turing",,English

The Selected Poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke,Rainer Maria Rilke,,,"Parallel German text and English translation.  The influence and popularity of Rilke’s poetry in America have never been greater than they are today, more than fifty years after his death. Rilke is unquestionably the most significant and compelling poet of romantic transformation, of spiritual quest, that the twentieth century has known. His poems of ecstatic identification with the world exert a seemingly endless fascination for contemporary readers.  In Stephen Mitchell’s versions, many readers feel that they have discovered an English rendering that captures the lyric intensity, fluency, and reach of Rilke’s poetry more accurately and convincingly than has ever been done before.  Mr. Mitchell is impeccable in his adherence to Rilke’s text, to his formal music, and to the complexity of his thoughts, at the same time, his work has authority and power as poetry in its own right. Few translators of any poet have arrived at the delicate balance of fidelity and originality that Mr. Mitchell has brought off with seeming effortlessness.

The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother,James McBride,,,"Touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.  Who is Ruth McBride Jordan? A self-declared """"light-skinned"""" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician and son, explores his mother's past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother.  The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in """"orchestrated chaos"""" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. """"Mommy,"""" a fiercely protective woman with """"dark eyes full of pep and fire,"""" herded her brood to Manhattan's free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion--and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain.  In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother's footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents' loveless marriage, her fragile, handicapped mother, her cruel, sexually-abusive father, and the rest of the family and life she abandoned.  At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all-black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. """"God is the color of water,"""" Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life's blessings and life's values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth's determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college--and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University.  Interspersed throughout his mother's compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self-realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.","Nonfiction, Memoir, Biography, Race, African American, Biography Memoir, School","291 pages, Paperback","First published January 1, 1995",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401311300i/29209.jpg,,,

The Last Temptation of Christ,Nikos Kazantzakis,,,"The internationally renowned novel about the life and death of Jesus Christ.

This literary rendering of the life of Jesus Christ has courted controversy since its publication by depicting a Christ far more human than the one seen in the Bible. He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other—subject to fear, doubt, and pain.  In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God’s will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ’s ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.  “Spiritual dynamite.” — San Francisco Chronicle  “A searing, soaring, shocking novel.” — Time","Fiction, Religion, Classics, Historical Fiction, Literature, Novels, Greece","506 pages, Paperback","March 1, 1998 by Simon & Schuster",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481512264i/8737.jpg,,9780684852560 (ISBN10: 068485256X),English

Around him he sees the great mass of inland Americans who have retired to California in expectation of health and ease. But boredom consumes them, their own emptiness maddens them, they search out any abnormality in their lust for excitement—drugs, perversion, crime.
